## What this kit delivers

1. **Natural Language Search** - Search across multiple sources using plain English queries
2. **Grounded Answers** - Get reliable answers with citations for trust and verification
3. **Clean UI Experience** - Instant "type → answer → cite" experience
4. **Enterprise Connectors** - Connect to Drive, SharePoint, S3, Sheets, OneDrive, Postgres via FireCrawl
5. **Zero-Copy Setup** - Index sources, drop in widget, and ship
6. **Team Collaboration** - Enable teams to work together with shared knowledge bases

## How it works

2. **Query & Retrieve** - Hybrid semantic + keyword retrieval, tuned for relevance
3. **Rank & Present** - Optionally re-rank; surface snippets + citations
4. **Answer & Render** - Render grounded response with links to original sources
5. **Stay Fresh** - Scheduled syncs keep results up to date
