# Firecrawl Documentation

Firecrawl is a robust tool designed to transform websites into LLM-ready data by leveraging its **Crawler** and **Scraper** functionalities. Whether you need to map website structures or extract specific data, Firecrawl provides a seamless and customizable solution.

<Callout type="warning" >
To use the Firecrawl node, you need to create a separate flow for crawling and scraping data. You can then utilize a webhook and integrate it into this distinct flow in the async node, or get the results directly in the sync node.
</Callout>

## Features

### ‚úÖ Key Functionalities
- **Web Crawling**: Systematically browse and index websites, discovering and mapping their structure.
- **Web Scraping**: Extract targeted content from specific web pages using customizable rules.
- **Integration with Webhooks**: Receive real-time updates about crawling and scraping activities.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Support for waiting on dynamic page loads and simulating mobile devices.

### ‚úÖ Benefits
- Generate structured data for language models.
- Customize inclusion and exclusion of website sections.
- Handle both static and dynamic web content.

## Prerequisites

Before using Firecrawl, ensure the following:

- A valid [Firecrawl API Key](https://www.firecrawl.dev/).
- Access to the Firecrawl service host URL.
- Properly configured credentials for Firecrawl.
- A webhook endpoint for receiving notifications (required for the crawler).

## Installation

### Step 1: Obtain API Credentials
1. Register on [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/).
2. Generate an API key from your account dashboard.
3. Note the **Host URL** and **Webhook Endpoint**.

### Step 2: Configure Firecrawl Credentials
Use the following format to set up your credentials:

| **Key Name**         | **Description**                                         | **Example Value**                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Credential Name**   | Name to identify this set of credentials                | `my-firecrawl-creds`             |
| **Firecrawl API Key** | Authentication key for accessing Firecrawl services     | `fc_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`           |
| **Host**              | Base URL where Firecrawl service is hosted             | `https://api.firecrawl.dev`      |


## Configuration Reference

Now, a crawler has two modes : 

1. **Async** 
2. **Sync**

<br/>
In asynchronous mode, the crawler will run in the background and notify you via a webhook when the crawl is complete.
<br/>
Whereas in synchronous mode, the crawler will run in the foreground and return results directly.
<br/>
In case of sync mode, the results will be returned as follows : 

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "status": "completed",
    "completed": 1,
    "total": 1,
