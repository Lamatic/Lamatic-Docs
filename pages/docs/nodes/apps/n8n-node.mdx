| **Schema Mismatch**        | Verify input/output schemas match between N8N and Lamatic workflows                        |

### Debugging

- Check Lamatic Flow logs for detailed error messages
- Verify N8N workflow status and trigger configurations
- Test webhook endpoints for accessibility and proper response
