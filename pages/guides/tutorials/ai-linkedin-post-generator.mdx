   ![Node Text Gen](./img/ai-Linkedin-post-generator/text-generator.png)
3. Configure the AI model:
   - Select your "Gemini" credentials
   - Choose "gemini-1.5-flash-8b-exp-0924" as your Model
4. Set up your prompt:

```

You will receive a newsletter text containing multiple sections. Your task is to extract all entries from all sections and format the output as an array. Each element in the array should be a JSON object with two keys:

"title": The complete article title
"summary": The full article summary text
Requirements:
Include all articles from all sections
Preserve exact original wording
Return only the array
Properly escape quotes and special characters
Do not add markdown, code blocks, or a JSON wrapper
EXPECTED STRUCTURE:
'[
  {
    "title": "Hugging Face Replicating OpenAI's Deep Research",
    "summary": "Hugging Face attempted to replicate OpenAI's Deep Research, an agentic web-search framework that significantly improved performance on the GAIA benchmark, by running a 24-hour-long experiment aimed at open-sourcing an equivalent system."
  },
  {
    "title": "Google CEO on DeepSeek vs. Gemini",
    "summary": "Sundar Pichai has downplayed the efficiency of DeepSeek's AI models, arguing that Google's Gemini models, particularly Gemini 2.0 Flash, outperform them despite DeepSeek's disruptive impact on the AI market."
  },
  {
    "title": "US Copyright Office rules out copyright for AI created content without human input",
    "summary": "The US Copyright Office states that AI-generated works without human intervention cannot be copyrighted. AI tools assisting with creativity, like de-aging actors, won't limit copyright protection, but purely generative AI outputs require further analysis."
  },
  {
    "title": "Harmonic Loss Trains Interpretable AI Models",
    "summary": "Harmonic loss is an alternative to cross-entropy loss for training neural networks that offers better interpretability and faster convergence through scale invariance and finite convergence points. Experiments across algorithmic, vision, and language datasets, demonstrate that models trained with harmonic loss show superior performance in interpretability, data efficiency, and reduced grokking compared to standard models. Harmonic loss could be particularly valuable for applications with limited data or where interpretability is crucial."
  },
