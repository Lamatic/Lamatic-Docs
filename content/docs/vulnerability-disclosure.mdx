# Vulnerability Disclosure Program

At Lamatic, we believe in collaborating with the global security researcher community to enhance the security of our products. By welcoming researchers to identify vulnerabilities in our systems, we aim to make our products more secure while fostering a cooperative security ecosystem. To this end, we reward researchers for their valuable contributions.

### In Scope
The following areas and vulnerabilities are included in the Bug Bounty Program:

1. **Products**
   - [Lamatic.ai Studio](https://studio.lamatic.ai/) - Web applications
   - APIs
   - Cloud services

2. **Vulnerability Categories**
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - SQL Injection
   - Authentication flaws
   - Data leakage
   - Privilege escalation

### Out of Scope
The following are not covered by the program:

1. Social engineering attacks
2. Physical security vulnerabilities
3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
4. Third-party integrations not owned or controlled by Lamatic

## Submission Guidelines

Security researchers are required to provide detailed information about identified vulnerabilities. Submissions should include:

1. A clear description of the vulnerability  
2. Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue  
3. An impact analysis outlining the potential risk  
4. Supporting evidence such as screenshots, videos, or scripts  
5. Recommendations for remediation

## Review Process

| **Step**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Acknowledgment**              | Confirm receipt of the report within **24-48 hours**. Assign a unique **Reference ID** to track the submission.                                                                                                                         |
| **2. Initial Assessment**          | - Validate the authenticity of the issue. <br/> - Perform a **Duplicate Check** to ensure the bug hasn’t been previously reported. <br/> - Share an NDA if necessary.                                                                  |
| **3. Severity Analysis**           | Assess the severity using a standard rating system such as **CVSS**: <br/> - **Critical**: Immediate, widespread impact (e.g., RCE, data breaches). <br/> - **High**: Significant functionality or security risks. <br/> - **Medium**: Moderate impact. <br/> - **Low**: Minor risks. |
| **4. Assignment & Prioritization** | Assign the validated issue to the appropriate team and prioritize based on severity.                                                                                                               |
| **5. Development & Fixing**        | Address the issue based on priority and ensure timely resolution.                                                                                                                                  |
| **6. Researcher Verification**     | Notify the researcher upon resolving the issue. Provide testing environments or evidence (e.g., logs, screenshots) for verification.                                                                 |
| **7. Reward & Closure**            | Issue the reward based on the severity, impact, and uniqueness of the vulnerability.                                                                                                               |
| **8. Post-Resolution Analysis**    | Conduct a root cause analysis to identify gaps in code review, testing, or system architecture.                                                                                                     |

## Rules of Engagement

To ensure ethical conduct, researchers are required to adhere to the following guidelines:

| **Do’s**                                    | **Don’ts**                                           |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Test only within the defined scope.        | Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept. |
| Avoid impacting production systems.        | Refrain from using automated tools that degrade performance. |
| Report vulnerabilities immediately.        | Do not access or modify data without explicit consent.  |
