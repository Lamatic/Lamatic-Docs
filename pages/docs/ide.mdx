# **IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in Lamatic**

In Lamatic, the IDE refers to the built-in interactive tools that help you easily build, debug, and optimize flows within the platform. Similar to traditional code IDEs, Lamatic's IDE provides a comprehensive environment for creating and managing flows efficiently.

Lamatic offers three specialized IDEs to cater to different aspects of flow development:

1. Prompt IDE
2. Code IDE
3. GraphQL IDE
