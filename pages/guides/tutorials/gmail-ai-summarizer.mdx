This guide will walk you through building an AI-powered email summarization tool. The system automatically processes incoming emails from Gmail, and generates concise summaries using a Large Language Model (LLM), allowing you to quickly understand important information.

## What You'll Build

A simple automation that triggers when a new email arrives in Gmail, processes the email content using an AI model, and generates a summary. This enables efficient email management by allowing users to quickly understand important details without reading lengthy messages.

## Getting Started

### 1. Project Setup

1. Sign up at [Lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai/) and log in.
2. Navigate to the Projects and click **New Project** or select your desired project.
3. You'll see different sections like Flows, Context, and Connections

### 2. Creating a New Flow

1. Navigate to Flows, select **New Flow**.
2. Click **Create from scratch** to start with a blank canvas.

### 3. Setting Up the Gmail Trigger

1. Click "Choose a Trigger" or the **+** button.
2. Search for and select **Gmail** under the App nodes.
3. Configure the Gmail node:
   - **Credentials**: Select your Gmail OAuth credentials (or create new ones).
   - **Action**: Select **On New Email**.

### 4. Adding AI Text Generation

1. Click the **+** icon below the Gmail node to add a new step.
2. Choose **Generate Text** (Text LLM).
3. Configure the AI model:
   - **Model**: Select a model (e.g., Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o).
   - **Prompt**: Enter a prompt to summarize the email. For example:
     ```
     Summarize this email content
     ```
   - **Input**: Insert the variable containing the email body. Click "Insert Variable" and select `message_text` from the Gmail node output.

### 5. Final Flow Overview

Your flow should look like this:
1. **Gmail Trigger**: Listens for new emails.
2. **Generate Text**: Summarizes the email content.

### 6. Test the Flow

1. Click **Test** on the Gmail node to fetch a sample email.
2. Click **Test** on the Generate Text node to see the summary generated from the sample email.

### 7. Deployment

1. Click the **Deploy** button in the top right corner.
2. Your flow is now live! It will automatically summarize new emails as they arrive.

### 8. What's Next?

- **Send the Summary**: Add another node (e.g., Slack, Email, or Notion) to send the generated summary to your preferred channel.
- **Filter Emails**: Add logic to only summarize emails from specific senders or with specific subjects.
- **Experiment with Prompts**: Refine the prompt to extract specific action items or formatting.

Now you have a working AI-powered email summarizer!
