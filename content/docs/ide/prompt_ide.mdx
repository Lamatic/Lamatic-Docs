Unlock the full potential of your flows with the **Prompt IDE**. This powerful feature enables you to craft custom prompts that align perfectly with your specific use cases. With **Prompt Templates**, you can design and fine-tune your prompts to elicit precise and relevant responses from your users or AI models. Whether you need to gather specific information, guide users through a complex process, or provide a more personalized experience, the Prompt IDE gives you the flexibility to tailor your prompts.

## **Writing Prompts in Rich Text**

The Prompt IDE supports **rich text formatting**, allowing you to structure your prompts effectively. You can use:

- **Bold**, *Italic*, and `Code Formatting`
- Ordered and unordered lists
- Headings and subheadings for better organization
- Inline code snippets and block code for structured prompts
- Real-time syntax highlighting and preview to refine prompts dynamically

## **Adding and Using Variables**

To make your prompts more dynamic and context-aware, you can **insert variables** directly into your prompts. Variables allow you to personalize responses or integrate real-time data into the prompt text.

1. Click **Insert Variable** to add dynamic placeholders.
2. Choose the data source:
   - **Project**: Use data specific to your project context.
   - **Organization**: Pull information from your organization-level settings.
   - **Secrets**: Use stored sensitive data securely.
3. Once inserted, the variable will be dynamically replaced during execution, enabling a personalized and adaptable prompt structure.

## **Creating Prompts for Different User Roles**

When crafting prompts, you can specify the **role** for the interaction:

- **System**: Defines the overarching instructions for the conversation.
- **User**: Represents the userâ€™s input or request.
- **Assistant**: Controls how the AI responds based on the provided context.

To set a role:
1. Use the **Role** dropdown in the editor.
2. Select **System**, **User**, or **Assistant**.
3. Customize the prompt content accordingly to guide the AI effectively.

This feature ensures a structured and contextually relevant prompt design, improving interactions and responses.

## **Key Features**
- Create dynamic prompts that adapt to user input and context.
- Design conditional logic to route users through different flows.
- Implement variable placeholders for personalized content.
- Test and iterate on prompts within the IDE for optimal results.

## **Reusing Saved Prompts in LLM Nodes**

Once youâ€™ve created and saved prompts in the Prompt IDE, you can reuse them in your **flows** when adding an **LLM Node**. This allows you to maintain a centralized library of prompts, ensuring consistency and efficiency in your AI interactions.

### **How to Use Saved Prompts in LLM Nodes**
1. **Add an LLM Node** to your flow.
2. Click on **Load Saved Config** to access previously created prompts.
3. Select the relevant prompt to apply it instantly.
4. The prompt will be prefilled, including all structured variables and formatting.

This feature enables seamless integration of reusable prompts, reducing redundancy and improving workflow efficiency.
