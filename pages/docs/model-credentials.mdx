# Credentials

Once you've selected the ideal LLM for your Lamatic.ai application through benchmarking and experimentation, the next step is to authenticate and access that model securely. Simply input the relevant credential values, Lamatic.ai provides a simple and secure way to manage your API credentials and securely access your chosen model.

## Accessing the chosen LLMs
With valid credentials in place, your Lamatic.ai application can now access the LLM via the provider's API. No more worrying about API keys, authentication flows, or managing HTTP requests!
Lamatic.ai abstracts away this complexity with a visual, no-code interface to call the model. Simply select your desired provider and LLM, configure any necessary parameters, and execute the request.
