## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are advanced language model (LLM) systems designed to perform complex tasks, including but not limited to text generation, summarization, and translation. These agents are capable of executing designated tasks autonomously and can also utilize various tools and functions to enhance their performance.
<br/> Here are some of the nodes available in Lamatic.ai:

### Generate Text

The Generate Text Agent Node empowers users to generate human-like text outputs tailored to their specific requirements. Whether it's crafting compelling marketing copy, generating creative narratives, or composing technical documentation, this Agent Node leverages advanced language models to produce high-quality, contextually relevant content.

**Node Input**

- `Prompt Template`: The prompt template used by the LLM to generate the output
- `Model Name`: Name of the model added to the Lamatic.ai platform

### Generate JSON

The Generate JSON Agent Node is a game-changer for developers working with structured data formats. It streamlines the process of generating JSON files, ensuring accuracy and consistency across various applications. From creating API payloads to generating configuration files, this Agent Node simplifies data exchange and integration, reducing development overhead.

**Node Input**

- `Schema`: The schema used to generate the JSON
- `Prompt Template`: The prompt template used by the LLM to generate the output
- `Model Name`: Name of the model added to the Lamatic.ai platform


### Summarise

In today's information-rich world, the ability to distill complex data into concise summaries is invaluable. The Summarise Agent Node harnesses the power of AI to analyze and synthesize large volumes of text, extracting the most salient points and presenting them in a condensed, easily digestible format.

**Node Input**

- `Text`: The text or document to be summarized 
- `Model Name`: Name of the model added to the Lamatic.ai platform


### Extract

The Extract Agent Node is a versatile tool for extracting specific information from unstructured data sources. Whether you need to extract named entities, key phrases, or specific data points, this Agent Node leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to accurately identify and retrieve the desired information.

**Node Input**

- `Data Source`: The data source from which the data is to be extracted
- `Format`: The format in which the data is to be extracted
- `Model Name`: Name of the model added to the Lamatic.ai platform

### Decision

The Decision Agent Node brings the power of AI-driven decision-making to your GenAI applications. By analyzing complex data, this Agent Node can assist in making informed decisions based on predefined criteria and business rules, streamlining decision-making processes and improving overall efficiency.

**Node Input**

- `Options`: The options that are avaiable to choose for the agent to make a decision
- `Model Name`: Name of the model added to the Lamatic.ai platform


### Search

The Search Agent Node is a powerful tool for exploring and navigating large datasets with ease. Leveraging cutting-edge search algorithms, this Agent Node enables users to quickly and accurately retrieve relevant information, whether it's from internal databases, external sources, or a combination of both.

**Node Input**

- `Type`: Type of search to perform from Hybrid, Keyword, or Semantic
- `Model Name`: Name of the model added to the Lamatic.ai platform
