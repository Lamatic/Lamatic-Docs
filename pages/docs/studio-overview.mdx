2. Click on the **Theme** option in the menu.
3. Select your preferred theme from the dropdown:

   - **Light** - Always use light theme
   - **Dark** - Always use dark theme

Your theme preference is saved automatically and will persist across sessions.

> 🎨 **Pro Tip**: Use **System** theme to automatically adapt to your environment, or choose a specific theme for consistent visual experience regardless of your device settings.
