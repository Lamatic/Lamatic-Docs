This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website, [Lamatic.ai](http://Lamatic.ai).

We will not collect, use, or share additional categories of your personal information for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes other than as described above without providing you notice.

## 4. INFORMATION SHARING AND PROCESSING:

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent. We may disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

Legal basis for processing your information: We are committed to minimizing the information we collect and limiting its use and purposes to only: (i) where we have your permission; (ii) as necessary to deliver our services; or (iii) as might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purpose. You may withdraw your consent to receiving our communications by clicking the unsubscribe link on any email you no longer wish to receive or by emailing us at [unsubscribe@Lamatic.ai](mailto:unsubscribe@Lamatic.ai).

Storage and transfer of your information: Your information is processed at our operating offices in the United States, on servers provided by our vendors in the United States,  and any other places where the parties involved in the processing may be located. If you utilize our services or contact us by telephone or online from a country other than the United States, your information may be transferred to a country outside your own. Also, when you contact us or use our services, we may provide you with support services that may require transfer of your information to locations that may be outside of your country of origin. In any case, your information remains governed by this Privacy Policy to the extent permissible in each applicable jurisdiction.

Retention of your information: Your information will be processed and stored for as long as required to complete the purpose for which it has been collected, such as providing you our services. Personal information collected for our legitimate business interests will be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. We will comply with all relevant and data privacy laws and regulations as pertinent to retention of your information. To the degree required by law, you may request copies or deletion of your information. Once all applicable statutory retention periods expire, your information may be deleted from our database. Following the deletion of your information, your right to access, delete, and correct the information, as well as your right to data portability, cannot be honored.

Google Workspace APIs are not used to develop, improve, or train generalized AI and/or ML models.

## 5. DATA SECURITY:

We secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When personal information (such as a wallet address or payment information) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, for example, but not by way of limitation or guarantee, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through our services cannot be guaranteed.

## 12. SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR EU RESIDENTS:

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), we are a data controller and data processor for the information we collect from you. If you are a European Union resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us using the contact information below.

Additionally, if you are a European Union resident, note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an order through the services), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests. Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to the United States.

You have specific rights under the GDPR, as follows:

- You may withdraw your previously provided consent to the processing of your information at any time.
- You may object to the processing of your information if it is being carried out for a purpose for which you have previously provided consent.
- You may access your specific information in our possession, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing, and obtain a copy of your information subject to processing.
- You may seek to have your information updated or corrected.
- Under certain circumstances, you may restrict the processing of your information, in which case we will refrain from any processing activity other than storage.
- You may seek to have your information deleted. We will honor your request to the extent that retention of your information is no longer necessary for us to fulfill our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record-keeping requirements.
- You may receive a copy of your information in a structured, commonly-used machine readable format that may be transferred to another controller without hindrance.

How Can You Exercise Your Rights?

You may request to exercise your rights to access, correction, deletion, and data portability of your information by contacting us at the contact information provided above. We will endeavor to respond to your request as promptly as possible but in any event in no more than 30 days from the receipt of your verifiable request.

Only you may request to exercise your rights or those of your minor child, and your request must be verifiable. Your verifiable consumer request must:

- provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and
- describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the information relates to you. We will only use information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request and for no other reason. Though you need not create an account to make a verifiable consumer request, we consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to information associated with that specific account. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to your account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

For requests to transfer your information to another entity, we will provide your information in a format of our choosing that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information without hindrance, for example in .PDF, .TXT, or .DOC format. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your verifiable consumer request. If applicable, our response will provide the reasons we cannot comply with your request.

We will not charge you a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why and provide a cost estimate before completing your request.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Unless permitted under applicable laws, solely due to the exercise of your rights hereunder, we will not:

- deny you goods or services;
- charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
- provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
- suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

## 13. SEVERABILITY:

If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Sections hereof that by their nature should survive termination hereof will so survive.
