| **Folder Path** | Path within the drive to target.<br/>Use `"."` to sync all folders | `.` | Yes |
| **Globs (Path Patterns)** | Glob pattern for matching files | `**` | No |
| **Sync Mode** | Controls how files are re-indexed:<br/>- `full_refresh`<br/>- `incremental` | `incremental` | Yes |
| **Sync Schedule** | Schedule for automated syncs | `Every 24 hours` | No |
| **Search Scope** | Scope of files to include:<br/>- `ACCESSIBLE_DRIVES`<br/>- `SHARED_ITEMS`<br/>- `ALL` | `ALL` | Yes |
| **Parsing Strategy** | Strategy for extracting content:<br/>- `fast`, `ocr_only`, `hi_r

- ‚úÖ Business documents (e.g., reports, contracts, spreadsheets)
- ‚úÖ Internal wikis and knowledge bases

## Tips

- Make sure your Microsoft account has appropriate **OneDrive API permissions** to access the selected files and drives.
- For scanned PDFs or images, prefer using `hi_res` or `ocr_only` parsing strategies for better text extraction.
- Optimize sync schedules using **cron expressions** to avoid unnecessary load (e.g., sync every night or every 6 hours).
