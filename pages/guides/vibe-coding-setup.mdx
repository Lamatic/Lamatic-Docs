# Vibe Coding with Lamatic.ai

Developers working on **Lamatic.ai Docs** can now supercharge productivity using AI‑assisted coding tools. This guide explains how to configure and use **Vibe Coding tools**—such as GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude—for a deeply contextualized coding experience powered by the `llm.txt` file.

## 1. Prerequisites

* Node.js **18+** and Git installed
* Access to the Lamatic.ai Docs repository
* Any LLM‑based coding assistant installed:
    * GitHub **Copilot** (extension enabled in VS Code)
    * **Cursor** IDE (with Lamatic project workspace loaded)
    * **Continue.dev** (community‑compatible setup)

## 2. Understanding `llm.txt`

The **`llm.txt`** file defines the directories and configuration files that AI tools should prioritize when offering suggestions. This ensures the assistant understands **Lamatic.ai’s architecture**, ensuring relevant and structured completions.

The file includes:

/components/ → Core UI and React elements
/pages/docs/ → Lamatic documentation and integration guides
/next.config.mjs → Next.js configuration
/package.json → Node.js project manifest
/pyproject.toml → Python project configuration

By guiding your LLM here, you prevent distractions from build artifacts or external modules.

## 3. Setting Up Vibe Coding Tools

### GitHub Copilot Setup

1.  Ensure the **Copilot extension** is installed in VS Code.
2.  Enable repository context loading by verifying `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles = true`.
3.  Copilot automatically references Lamatic’s structure similar to Cursor’s `.cursorrules`.
4.  Start typing in `/components/` or `/pages/docs/`, and watch Copilot adapt to Lamatic’s context instantly.

### Cursor Integration

1.  Open the Lamatic Docs root folder in **Cursor IDE**.
2.  Cursor automatically respects the `llm.txt` file as its project context.
3.  Use the in‑line prompt (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) to generate or refactor code.
    Example prompt:
    > “Based on Lamatic’s `DocsNav` component, generate a collapsible section with AI‑powered section titles.”

Cursor lets you connect custom AI APIs too—ideal for contributors using their own OpenAI or Anthropic credentials for Lamatic.ai development.

## 4. Example Prompts and Best Practices

| Scenario | Basic Prompt | Context‑Aware Prompt |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Component Creation** | "Make a new button" | "Using Lamatic’s `Button.tsx` design from `/components/ui/`, create a `PrimaryBadge` variant matching Lamatic.ai styling." |
| **Documentation Enhancement** | "Add integration doc" | "Following `/pages/docs/integrations`, create a doc titled `AI Automation Setup` demonstrating Lamatic.ai’s workflow configuration." |
| **API Logic** | "Write API route" | "In reference to `pyproject.toml` dependencies, implement a Python FastAPI route for Lamatic.ai’s webhook ingestion." |

**Pro Tip:** Include component or page paths in prompts (e.g., `components/ui/Button.tsx`)—LLMs use them as explicit context anchors.

## 5. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Recommended Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| **AI not responding contextually** | IDE not loading `llm.txt` | Restart your environment or reload the Lamatic Docs workspace. |
| **Off‑theme code suggestions** | Outdated assistant cache | Clear Copilot/Cursor cache or reload Lamatic configuration. |
| **Code format mismatches** | Local ESLint not running | Execute `npm run lint` or `npm run format`. |

### Why This Matters

Lamatic.ai thrives on collaborative, intelligent documentation. By configuring `llm.txt` correctly and aligning Vibe Coding tools to it, your LLM assistant effectively “understands” Lamatic’s structure—making your prompts smarter, faster, and fully contextual.

These improvements allow new contributors to **get productive immediately**, reducing setup friction and ensuring Lamatic.ai remains a pioneer in developer‑friendly AI documentation integration.
