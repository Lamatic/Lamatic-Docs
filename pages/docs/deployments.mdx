## **What is Edge Deployment?**

Edge deployment is an innovative approach to running applications and services that brings computation closer to the end-users. This method utilizes a network of geographically distributed nodes or servers strategically positioned around the globe. By implementing this decentralized architecture, edge deployment significantly reduces latency and enhances overall performance. The key principle behind this technology is minimizing the distance that data needs to travel between the user and the application, resulting in faster response times and improved user experiences.

### **The Inner Workings of Edge Deployment**

1. **Initiation**: The process begins when you click the `🚀 Deploy` button. This action triggers the system to save your meticulously crafted Flow as a comprehensive LowCode Configuration, capturing all the intricacies of your application design.
2. **Transformation**: The LowCode Configuration undergoes a sophisticated transpilation process, converting it into a highly optimized TypeScript bundle. This bundle is enriched with essential resources, including your specified Model parameters and secure App Credentials, ensuring a complete package for deployment.
3. **Distribution**: The final step involves the seamless deployment of the TypeScript bundle across our expansive, distributed Edge network. This strategic distribution ensures that your application is readily available at numerous points of presence worldwide, primed for high performance and low latency.

> 💡 **Note**: While our advanced systems typically complete this intricate deployment process in less than a minute, please note that during periods of high deployment volume across our platform, the process might require additional time. Rest assured, we're continuously optimizing our systems to maintain the fastest possible deployment times without compromising on quality or security.
