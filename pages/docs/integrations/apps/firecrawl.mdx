# Firecrawl
We have a Crawler and Scraper node designed to transform websites into LLM-ready data using [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/).

## Prerequisites

Before using Firecrawl, ensure you have the following:

- A valid [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) API Key.
- Access to the Firecrawl service host URL.
- Credentials set up for Firecrawl.
- A webhook endpoint for receiving notifications (required for crawler).

## Understanding Crawler vs Scraper

### Web Crawler

A web crawler, also known as a spider, systematically browses and indexes web pages by following links between pages. It's designed to discover and map website structure and content relationships.

### Web Scraper

A web scraper extracts specific data from web pages according to defined rules. It focuses on gathering particular information from targeted pages rather than discovering new pages.

## Troubleshooting Guidelines

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your API key is correct and has not expired. Check your Firecrawl account for key status.
- **Connection Problems**: Verify the host URL is correct.
- **Credential Errors**: Double-check that the credentials are correctly set up and selected in the configuration.
- **Webhook Failures**: Ensure the webhook endpoint is active and correctly configured to receive notifications.
- **Crawl/ Scrape Errors**: Review the URL patterns and ensure they are correctly specified in the include/exclude lists.
