## What is a node?

Nodes are the basic building blocks of any Lamatic workflow. Nodes have many different functions
depending on their type and can be linked together in near infinite ways.

## Types of Nodes

- **Data**: Transform your data for use in the workflow
- **Agents**: Communicate with models and retrieve generated results
- **Flow**: Format and enhance collected data and responses from models
- **Apps**: Connect to various third-party applications for input or output

## What does a node consist of?

A workflow nodes consists of a name and various imput paramers that differ 
depending on the type of node. Nodes take in information from the previous node 
and this information is transformed and passed to the next node.

## What is a node connection?

A node connection is a connection from one node earlier in the workflow to the next
node in the chain. These connections allow us to link one or more nodes to 
another for increased workflow capabilities.

## Input Variables

These are variables that are created and modified by earler nodes in a workdlow and can be fed into 
a node to allow information to be passed from one node to another in a sequence.

## Node Testing

The platform supports testing nodes for a specific use case, keeping constant and executing all the 
nodes before it in the workflow, allowing different input parameters to be tested to determine the best 
node configuration for the right output.
