# What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval Augemented Generation. RAG is a technique that combines information retrieval with generative AI, where the system retrieves relevant information from a Knowledge Base and then uses that information to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses or content.
<br/> A Knowledge Base can be anything, it can be something as simple as a PDF, or a Word document to something as complex as an SQL DataBase
