## A Choreographer's Toolbox

### Code Node
Inject custom code integrations, bridging your unique logic into the AI workflow using Python, JavaScript or any language.

### Condition Node
Implement intelligent control flows, branching your pipelines based on dynamic conditions, data filters, and rules.

### API Node
Interoperate with external APIs and services, blending generative outputs with broader systems and data ecosystems.

### Webhook Node
Seamlessly ingest event triggers from webhooks, allowing you to activate real-time event-driven AI processing flows.

### Followup Node
For conversational AI, maintain context and dialogue state to drive coherent multi-turn interactions and flows.

### Web Search Node
Leverage the open knowledge of the web, injecting web search results as supplemental context for your AI models.

### Query DB Node
Tap into your database repositories to enhance AI outputs with enterprise data context and signals.

### Workflow Node
Modularize processing patterns into reusable sub-workflow components you can mix, match and templatize.

### Website Node
Scrape data from websites, extract structured information, and inject it into your AI workflows.

### Experiment Node
Run A/B tests, explore what-if scenarios, and continuously validate and optimize your AI-powered data products.
