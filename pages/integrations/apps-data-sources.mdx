# Apps & Data Sources

Apps and Data Sources are the foundational connectors that enable Lamatic Studio to interact with external systems, services, and data repositories. These integrations serve as the data ingestion layer for your AI workflows, allowing you to seamlessly connect to various platforms, databases, and cloud services to feed data into your agentic flows and RAG applications.

<br/>
[Lamatic.ai](http://Lamatic.ai) provides a comprehensive suite of pre-built integrations that simplify the process of connecting to popular data sources, enabling you to focus on building intelligent applications rather than managing complex data pipelines.
