### Sync Configuration Options

#### Sync Modes
```yaml
# Incremental Sync (recommended)
sync_mode: "incremental"  # Only sync new/modified files

# Full Refresh
sync_mode: "full_refresh"  # Re-index all files
```

#### Schedule Examples
```yaml
# Daily at midnight
sync_schedule: "0 0 * * *"

# Every 6 hours
sync_schedule: "0 */6 * * *"

# Weekdays only at 9 AM
sync_schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5"
```

### File Filtering Patterns

#### Common Glob Patterns
```yaml
# All PDF files
globs: "**/*.pdf"

# All Word and Excel files
globs: "**/*.docx", "**/*.xlsx"

# Files in specific folders
globs: "HR/**/*", "Legal/**/*"

# Exclude draft folders
globs: "**/*", "!**/draft/**"
```

#### Search Scope Options
- **`ACCESSIBLE_DRIVES`**: Only files in drives you have direct access to
- **`SHARED_ITEMS`**: Files shared with you by others
- **`ALL`**: All accessible files (recommended)

## Low-Code Example

```yaml
triggerNode:
  nodeId: triggerNode_1
  nodeType: sharepointBusinessNode
  nodeName: SharePoint Business
  values:
    credentials: Microsoft 365
    site_url: https://company.sharepoint.com/sites/documents
    folder_path: .
    globs: ["**/*.pdf", "**/*.docx"]
    sync_mode: incremental
    sync_schedule: "0 2 * * *"
    search_scope: ALL
    parsing_strategy: fast
    days_to_sync_if_history_full: 30

folder_path: "."
globs: "**/*.pdf", "**/*.docx"
sync_mode: "incremental"
search_scope: "ALL"
parsing_strategy: "fast"
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
# Advanced setup with scheduling and filtering

folder_path: "./TeamDocs"
globs: "**/*.pdf", "**/*.docx", "!**/draft/**"
sync_mode: "incremental"
sync_schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
search_scope: "ALL"

folder_path: "./Policies"
globs: "**/*.pdf", "**/*.docx"
sync_mode: "incremental"
search_scope: "ACCESSIBLE_DRIVES"
parsing_strategy: "ocr_only"  # Better for scanned documents
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**                    | **Solution**                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication Failed**      | Verify Tenant ID is correct and you have SharePoint access permissions                     |
| **Site Not Found**             | Check the Site URL format and ensure you have access to the specified site                 |
| **Files Not Syncing**          | Verify folder path exists and glob patterns are correctly formatted                        |
| **Permission Denied**          | Ensure your Microsoft 365 account has appropriate SharePoint permissions                   |
| **Sync Not Scheduled**         | Check cron expression format and ensure sync schedule is properly configured                |
| **Parsing Errors**             | Verify parsing strategy is appropriate for the document types being processed              |
| **Large File Issues**          | Check file size limits and consider using incremental sync for large repositories          |

### Debugging

- Check Lamatic Flow logs for detailed error messages
- Verify Microsoft 365 credentials and Tenant ID
- Test SharePoint site access in your browser
- Validate folder path exists and is accessible
- Test glob patterns to ensure they match your documents
- Monitor sync logs for specific file processing errors
- Verify network connectivity and API rate limits
- Test with a small folder before processing large repositories

### Best Practices

- Use `incremental` sync mode for better performance
- Implement specific glob patterns to avoid syncing unnecessary files
- Schedule syncs during off-peak hours to minimize impact
- Use `hi_res` parsing for scanned documents and images
- Regularly monitor sync logs for any issues
- Set appropriate `days_to_sync_if_history_full` to limit historical data
- Test parsing strategies with sample documents before full deployment

## Example Use Cases

### Document Intelligence Workflows
- **Company Policies**: Sync HR policies and procedures for automated Q&A
- **Knowledge Bases**: Index departmental wikis and team documentation
- **Compliance Documents**: Process legal and audit-related content
- **Project Documentation**: Automate access to project files and reports

### RAG Applications
- **Semantic Search**: Enable natural language search across organizational documents
- **Question Answering**: Build AI assistants that can answer questions about company policies
- **Document Summarization**: Automatically summarize lengthy reports and documents
- **Content Discovery**: Help users find relevant information across SharePoint sites
