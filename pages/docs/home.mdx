## Project List

The main section of the Project Home displays a list of all projects created within the organization. Each project is represented by a card containing the project's name and a brief description of its purpose or focus area.
Each project displays additional metadata, such as the project's live/active status, the last time it was edited, and the team members or collaborators involved in the project.

## Navigation and Project Management

From the Project Home, organizations can easily navigate to individual project workspaces, where they can access project-specific tools, resources, and functionalities. This centralized hub simplifies project management by enabling users to create new projects, access existing ones, and maintain an overall view of the organization's project portfolio.
