description: This guide will help you build an AI-powered article summarization system. The workflow takes an article URL as input, uses a Firecrawl scraper node to extract the content, and passes the data to an LLM node to generate a concise summary. This automation enables quick and efficient information retrieval, making it easier to digest lengthy articles.

# AI powered Article Summarizer

This guide will help you build an AI-powered article summarization system. The workflow processes article URLs provided by users, extracts content using the Firecrawl scraper node, and generates a concise summary using an LLM node. This system enables efficient data extraction and quick information retrieval, making it easier to digest lengthy articles.

## What You'll Build

A simple API that processes article URLs provided by users, extracts content using the Firecrawl scraper node, and generates a concise summary using an LLM node. This API enables seamless data extraction, making it easier to quickly understand and analyze lengthy articles for a wide range of applications.

3. Configure the AI model:
   - Select your "Open AI" credentials
   - Choose "gpt-4-turbo" as your Model
4. Set up your prompt:

   ```
   I will provide you with a markdown file containing an article.
   Extract the key points and generate a detailed yet concise summary, capturing the main ideas, arguments, and insights presented in the article.
   Ensure the summary is well-structured and easy to understand.
   Markdown Content: {{scraperNode_520.output.markdown}}

   ```

- You can add variables using the "Add Variable" button
