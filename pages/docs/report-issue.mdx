# Confidential Whistleblower Reporting

Speak up safely and securely about potential violations or concerns

<br />

This Whistleblower Form is intended to encourage and enable employees and others to communicate potential legal and ethical concerns to appropriate leadership and oversight teams to allow Vanta to address and correct inappropriate conduct and actions. It is the responsibility of all board members, officers, employees, and contractors to report concerns about violations of code of ethics or suspected violations of law or regulations that govern Vantaâ€™s operations.

<br />
All information gathered will remain anonymous and only provided to appropriate teams
to facilitate escalation and remediation. It is prohibited by Vanta for anyone to
retaliate against any individual who in good faith reports an ethics violation or
a suspected violation of law, such as a complaint of discrimination, suspected fraud,
or potential violation of any regulation related to Vanta's operations. Any employee
who retaliates against an individual who has reported a violation in good faith is
subject to disciplinary measures, up to and including termination of employment.
Reports of violations or suspected violations will be kept confidential to the extent
possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.{" "}
