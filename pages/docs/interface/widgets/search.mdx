# Search Widget

Integrate our powerful search widget into your website using the search nodes. This widget leverages AI driven search technology to provide more accurate and relevant search results by understanding the context and meaning of the queries rather than just matching keywords. Now, you can offer this advanced search functionality directly on your site.

## Steps to Integrate the Search Widget

Follow these steps to integrate the search widget into your site using the provided CDN script:

### 1. Whitelist Your Domains

To use the Search Widget, you need to whitelist the domains where you will deploy the widget. This ensures that the widget is only used on approved domains.

- **Update your `searchTrigger` settings** to include the domains you plan to use.
- This configuration is typically done through your admin panel or server settings.

### 2. Include the CDN Script and Configure the Widget

Add the CDN script to your HTML file and configure the widget using the provided options.

Hereâ€™s how to include the CDN script and configure the widget:

```html
<script async src="https://widget.lamatic.ai/search/index.js" onload="loadSearchDialog()"></script>

<script>
  // Set Lamatic config
  var SEARCH_DIALOG_CONFIG = {
    apiUrl: 'https://example.lamatic.workers.dev', // The base URL of your project endpoint (REQUIRED)
    workflowId: 'demo-workflow-id', // The workflow ID where you have set up your search configuration (REQUIRED)
    customButtonId: 'searchButton', // The ID of a custom button that triggers the search dialog
    primaryColor: '#007bff', // The primary color for the search widget (HEX value only)
    titleTextColor: '#007bff', // The color of the title text in the search results
    subTitleTextColor: '#666', // The color of the subtitle text in the search results
    width: '60vw', // The width of the search dialog box
    showNavHelperText: true, // Whether to show helper text for navigation within the search results
    showEscapeHelperText: true, // Whether to show helper text for escaping the search dialog
    searchPlaceholderText: 'Search our knowledge base...', // The placeholder text for the search input
    searchDebounce: 200, // The debounce time (in milliseconds) for search input
    linkTarget: "_blank", // The target attribute for links in search results
    breakpoint: 768, // The breakpoint (in pixels) for responsive design
    fontFamily: "Arial" // The font family to be used in the search widget
  };

  // Load Lamatic dialog
  function loadSearchDialog() { new SearchDialog(SEARCH_DIALOG_CONFIG) };
</script>
```
