# Google Drive Integration

<IntegrationOverviw slug="google-drive"/>

## Overview

The Google Drive node in Lamatic automates fetching and synchronizing files from Google Drive. It supports various file types, including Google Docs, Slides, Word Documents, PDFs, and text files. This node enables regular file synchronization to support vectorization and indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) flows.

<Callout type="warning" >
To use the Google Drive node, you need to create a separate flow to Implement RAG. You can integrate it into this distinct flow.
</Callout>

## Features

### ✅ Key Functionalities

- **Batch Trigger**: Automates file fetching and synchronization on a schedule.
- **File Type Support**: Handles Google Docs, Slides, Word Documents, PDFs, and text files.

### ✅ Benefits

- Streamlines file collection from Google Drive.
- Prepares files for vectorization and indexing to enhance RAG flows.


## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Google Drive node, ensure you have the following:

- Google Drive credentials for accessing the desired folder.
- The target folder URL from Google Drive.
- An understanding of Cron expressions for scheduling flows.



## Setup

### Step 1: Set Up Lamatic Flow

1. **Create a Custom Flow** for Google Drive
   1. Configure the Node
2. **Use Pre-built Templates**: Start with our `Google Drive Template`

### Step 2: Configure Node in Lamatic

1. Add the Google Drive node to your flow.
2. Provide necessary credentials and folder details.
3. Schedule the flow using a Cron expression for regular execution.

### Step 3: Testing
```json
{
    "document_key": "your_filename", 
    "content": "data or text that will be stored in the document"
}
```

1. `content`: Represents the data or text that will be stored in the document.
1. `document_key`: Serves as the unique identifier for the document, used to locate or update the specific file Or Filename.

For testing, you need to manually provide `content` and `document_key` as dummy data. Once deployed, these values will be automatically fetched from your configured Google Drive folder.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**          | Display name for the node.                                                                             | ✅           | `Google Drive`                                       |
| **Credentials**   | Google authentication details required to connect to the Drive folder.                                 | ✅           | `my-google-drive-credentials`                        |
| **Folder**        | The folder from which files will be fetched.                                                           | ✅           | `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{folder-id}` |
| **Sync Mode**     | Specify either `incremental` (process new/updated files only) or `full-refresh` (reprocess all files). | ✅           | `incremental`                                        |
| **Sync Schedule** | Frequency for running the flow, specified using a Cron expression.                                     | ✅           | `0 0 05 1/1 * ? * UTC`                               |


### Low-Code Example

```yaml
triggerNode:
  nodeId: triggerNode_1
  nodeType: googleDriveNode
  nodeName: Google Drive
  values:
    process: batch
    syncMode: incremental_append
    credentials: Google Drive OAuth
    cronExpression: 0 0 */12 ? * * UTC
    folderUrl: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_ID
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**                | **Solution**                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invalid Credentials**    | Verify that the correct Google Drive credentials are provided.                         |
| **Folder Not Found**       | Ensure the folder URL is accurate and accessible.                                      |
| **Sync Not Working**       | Check the Cron expression for correctness.                                             |
| **File Types Unsupported** | Confirm that the files in the folder are of supported types (Google Docs, PDFs, etc.). |

### Debugging

- Check Lamatic Flow logs for error details.
- Verify Google Drive API access permissions.
- Test the folder URL to ensure it’s valid and accessible.
