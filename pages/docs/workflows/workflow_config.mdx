2. **Manage Data Flow**: Control the flow of data between nodes, ensuring that the right inputs are passed to the appropriate nodes at the right time.

3. **Implement Custom Logic**: Leverage the power of code to implement custom logic, decision-making, and conditional branching within your workflows.

4. **Integrate External Services**: Seamlessly integrate external services, APIs, and data sources into your workflows, enabling you to build truly comprehensive GenAI solutions.

5. **Optimize Performance**: Fine-tune performance parameters, such as caching, parallelization, and resource allocation, to ensure your workflows run efficiently and cost-effectively.
