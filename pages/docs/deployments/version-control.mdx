### Features in the Version Control Sidebar
- **List of Saved Versions**: Each version is time-stamped and labeled with the creatorâ€™s email.
- **Preview Option**: Clicking on the three dots next to any version allows you to preview the exact configuration and logic used.
- **Duplicate Option**: Users can duplicate a previous version to create a new flow based on it.

## Previewing a Previous Version
Clicking **Preview** opens a structured JSON view of the flowâ€™s configuration, helping users compare differences between versions.
