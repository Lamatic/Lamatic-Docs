## What is Logflare ?

Logflare is a powerful logging service that streamlines the process of pushing logs from your GenAI applications to a centralized location. With Log Flare, you can effortlessly capture and transmit log data in real-time, ensuring that you have a comprehensive record of your application's activities, errors, and events.

## The role of Google Big Query

While Logflare excels at pushing logs, Google BigQuery is the perfect complement for pulling and analyzing log data. As a highly scalable and cost-effective data warehouse solution, BigQuery allows you to retrieve logs pushed by Log Flare, providing you with a centralized repository for all your log data.
