Enable **AI-powered search + chat** across your content, with a simple, fast interface.

and returns results with **citations**.

## How it works

1. **Ingest & index** — Connect sources; Lamatic scrapes (FireCrawl), chunks, embeds, and stores with metadata.
2. **Query & retrieve** — Hybrid semantic + keyword retrieval, tuned for relevance.
3. **Rank & present** — Optionally re-rank; surface **snippets + citations**.
4. **Answer** — Render grounded response; include links to original sources.
5. **Stay fresh** — Scheduled syncs keep results up to date.

## Vertical use cases

- **Support** — Deflect tickets with cited answers from policies and runbooks.
- **Ops & IT** — Resolve “how-to” and config questions in seconds.
- **Sales/CS** — Compare product features & pricing with cited collateral.
- **Engineering** — Surface RFCs, design docs, playbooks, and runbooks instantly.
- **HR/People** — Answer benefits and policy questions, with links to the source.

## Customization paths

- **Data sources**: Google Drive, SharePoint, OneDrive, Sheets, S3, Postgres, Websites.
- **UI**: Theme, logo, fonts, and widget placement.
- **Ranking**: Adjust scorer/re-ranker; control snippet length and cite density.
- **Policies**: Redaction rules, stop-lists, allow-lists, domain scoping.
- **Observability**: Enable query logs, citations clicked, no-result reasons.

## Configuration best practices

- **Chunking**: Keep chunks 400–1200 tokens; include titles & headings as metadata.
- **Metadata**: Author, date, source, path; use as **filters** and **facets**.
- **Relevance**: Start hybrid (BM25 + vector); tune k and cutoffs after logs.
- **Citations**: Default on; require at least 2 distinct sources for “high confidence”.
- **Syncs**: Schedule FireCrawl recrawls and connector syncs based on change rate.

---

## Success metrics

- **Search → click-through rate** (CTR) on cited sources
- **First-answer success rate** (no follow-up needed)
- **No-results rate** (and reasons)
- **Support deflection** and **time-to-answer**
- **Content coverage** (indexed vs. total)

---

## Security & governance

- **ACLs respected** — results filtered by user permissions.
- **PII redaction** — configurable policies for masking.
- **Audit logs** — per-query traces; who saw what, when.
- **Data residency** — configurable storage regions.

Yes—permissions are enforced at query time.

**Can we add web pages?**  
Yes—use FireCrawl for site scraping and scheduled recrawls.
