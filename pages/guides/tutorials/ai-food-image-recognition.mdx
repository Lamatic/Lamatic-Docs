# Recipe Generation With AI

This guide will help you build an AI-powered recipe Generation system. The system processes image links provided by users, identifies food in the images, and generates a structured output. Each identified dish includes its name, ingredients, and cooking instructions, offering a seamless way to analyze and generate recipe ideas from food images.

## What You'll Build

A simple API that processes image links provided by users, identifies food in the images, and generates a structured output. Each identified dish includes its name, ingredients, and cooking instructions. This API enables seamless extraction of meaningful data from food images, ensuring efficient and accurate recipe generation for a wide range of culinary applications.

## Getting Started

### 1. Project Setup

1. Sign up at [Lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai/) and log in.
1. Navigate to the Projects and click **New Project** or select your desired project.
1. You'll see different sections like Flows, Context, and Connections

### 2. Creating a New Flow

1. Navigate to Flows, select New Flow.
2. Click **Create from scratch** as starting point.
   ![Flow selection](./img/ai-review-responder/flow-start.png)

### 3. Setting Up Your API

1. Click "Choose a Trigger"
2. Select "API Request" under the interface options
   ![Flow API](./img/ai-review-responder/flow-step2.png)
3. Configure your API:
   - Add your Input Schema
   - Set url as parameter in input schema
   - Set response type to "Real-time"
     ![Flow API Schema](./img/ai-article-summarizer/api-schema.png)
   - Click on save

### 4. Adding AI Text Generation

1. Click the + icon to add a new node
2. Choose "Generate Text"
   ![Node Text Gen](./img/ai-currency-converter/text-gen-node1.png)
3. Configure the AI model:
   - Select your "Gemini" credentials
   - Choose "gemini-1.5-pro-latest" as your Model
4. Under prompts section click the + icon to add prompt
5. Set up your prompt:

   ```
   Instructions:
   Analyze the image at the given URL:
   URL: {{triggerNode_1.output.url}}
   Task Objectives:
   Identify the dish shown in the image (e.g. sushi, biryani, etc.).
   Provide a detailed recipe for the identified dish.
   Recipe Details:

   Include:
   Dish name.
   Description.
   Serving size (e.g., "Yields: 2 servings").
   Prep time and cook time.
   Ingredients Section:
   Group ingredients logically (e.g., "noodles," "sauce," "stir-fry").
   Instructions Section:
   Provide step-by-step preparation and cooking directions.

   ```

- You can add variables using the "insert Variable" button

### 5. Configuring the reponse

1. Click the API response node
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/image-description-generator/flow-api-schema.png)
2. Add Output Variables by clicking the + icon
3. Select variable from your Code Node

### 7. Test the flow

1. Click on 'API Request' trigger node
2. Click on Configure test
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/ai-image-reviewer/testing.png)
3. Fill sample value in 'url' and click on test

### 8. Deployment

1. Click the Deploy button
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/ai-review-responder/deploy.png)
2. Your API is now ready to be integrated into Node.js or Python applications
3. Your flow will run on Lamatic's global edge network for fast, scalable performance

### 9. What's Next?

- Experiment with different prompts
- Try other AI models
- Add more processing steps to your flow
- Integrate the API into your applications

### 10. Tips

- Save your tests for reuse across different scenarios
- Use consistent JSON structures for better maintainability
- Test thoroughly before deployment

Now you have a working AI-powered API! You can expand on this foundation to build more complex applications using Lamatic.ai's features.
