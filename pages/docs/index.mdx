# Overview

> Lamatic is a GenOps platform that enables product teams with distributed AI systems to federate, operate and collaborate in one place. This improves visibility, accelerates workflow and reduces tech debt enabling teams to iterate these systems much faster. Lamatic is highly performant with a fully managed vector database, an easy-to-integrate GraphQL API and workflows deployed on edge. These capabilities give product teams the advantage they need without worrying about platform engineering.
