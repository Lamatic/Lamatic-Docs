## Low-Code Example

```yaml
nodes:
  - nodeId: codeNode_590
    nodeType: codeNode
    nodeName: Code
    values:
      code: var a = 5
    needs:
      - triggerNode_1
  - nodeId: plus-node-addNode_392806
    nodeType: addNode
    nodeName: ""
    values: {}
    needs:
      - codeNode_590
```
## Output
- The  result produced by the JavaScript script after execution.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**            | **Solution**                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Syntax Errors**      | Review the JavaScript code for typos or errors and use the testing tools to debug. |
| **Unexpected Outputs** | Validate input parameters and ensure proper mapping to outputs.                    |
| **Execution Failures** | Check node logs for error details and verify all dependencies.                     |

### Debugging Tips

- Use the built-in code editor to test and validate JavaScript logic.
- Verify the flow structure to ensure nodes are correctly connected.
- Check Lamatic Flow logs for error messages and execution details.
- Monitor input and output data to confirm the correct flow of information.

By leveraging the Lamatic.ai Code Node, you can create highly customized, efficient, and scalable flow tailored to your specific needs.
