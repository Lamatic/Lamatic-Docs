description: This guide will help you build an AI-powered article summarization system. The workflow takes an article URL as input, uses a Firecrawl scraper node to extract the content, and passes the data to an LLM node to generate a concise summary. This automation enables quick and efficient information retrieval, making it easier to digest lengthy articles.
