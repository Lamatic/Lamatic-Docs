## Low-Code Example

```yaml
nodes:
  - nodeId: codeNode_590
    nodeType: codeNode
    nodeName: Code
    values:
      code: var a = 5
    needs:
      - triggerNode_1
  - nodeId: plus-node-addNode_392806
    nodeType: addNode
    nodeName: ""
    values: {}
    needs:
      - codeNode_590
```
## Output
- The  result produced by the JavaScript script after execution.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**            | **Solution**                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Syntax Errors**      | Review the JavaScript code for typos or errors and use the testing tools to debug. |
| **Unexpected Outputs** | Validate input parameters and ensure proper mapping to outputs.                    |
| **Execution Failures** | Check node logs for error details and verify all dependencies.                     |

### Debugging Tips

- Use the built-in code editor to test and validate JavaScript logic.
- Verify the flow structure to ensure nodes are correctly connected.
- Check Lamatic Flow logs for error messages and execution details.
- Monitor input and output data to confirm the correct flow of information.
