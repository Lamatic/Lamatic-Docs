# Getting Started with Agents  

Agents in Lamatic.ai are AI-driven components designed to automate flow, process data, and generate intelligent responses. Whether you're building a chatbot, structuring data, or orchestrating multiple AI models, agents provide a flexible and efficient way to handle tasks.  You can create agents in two ways: **via the Flow Editor** (for seamless integration into flow) or **via the Agent Dashboard** (for standalone configuration and management). Follow the steps below to get started.
