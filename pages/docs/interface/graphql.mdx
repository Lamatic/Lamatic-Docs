# Executing Flows with GraphQL API

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language developed by Facebook. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs. GraphQL allows clients to define the structure of the data they need, enabling them to retrieve precisely the information they require with a single request.

### GraphQL over REST

While REST APIs have been the industry standard for many years, they often suffer from over-fetching or under-fetching data, leading to inefficient data transfers and increased latency. GraphQL addresses these limitations by empowering clients to request only the data they need, reducing network overhead and improving performance.


## Setting up
### Automatic Docs

The easies way to setup GraphQL Connection is to click the Connect bar and get the automated code for your project.
Lamatic.ai also generate automatic API documentation for your project. You can access it by visiting the API Docs section.
### Authentication with API Keys

To ensure secure access to our platform, Lamatic.ai employs API keys for authentication. When triggering flows via GraphQL, you'll need to include your API key in the request headers. This key serves as a unique identifier, granting you authorized access to our services while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your data.

Here's an example of how you can include the API key in your GraphQL request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```

By including the API key in the `Authorization` header, our platform can verify your identity and grant you access to trigger the desired flow.

### Triggering Flows with GraphQL

Lamatic.ai's GraphQL integration allows you to trigger your GenAI flows seamlessly using GraphQL queries. This approach provides a standardized and efficient way to interact with our platform, enabling you to execute your GenAI flows on-demand or as part of larger application flows.

Here's an example GraphQL query that demonstrates how you can trigger a flow:

<Tabs items={['JavaScript', 'Python', 'cURL']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```javascript
   const axios = require('axios');
 
const query = `
query ExecuteWorkflow(
    $workflowId: String!
    $prompt: String    
) {
    executeWorkflow(
    workflowId: $workflowId
    payload: {
      prompt: $prompt
    }
    ) {
        status
        result
    }
}`;
 

const variables = {"workflowId":"your_workflow_id","prompt":"The excited car draws."};

const options = {
method: 'POST',
url: 'your_project_endpoint',
headers: {
  "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
},
data: { query, variables }
};
 
axios(options)
.then(response => console.log(response.data))
.catch(error => console.error(error));

    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```python
    import requests

query = """
query ExecuteWorkflow(
    $workflowId: String!
    $prompt: String        
) {
    executeWorkflow(
    workflowId: $workflowId
    payload: {
      prompt: $prompt
    }
    ) {
        status
        result
    }
}
"""

variables = {"workflowId":"your_workflow_id","prompt":"The excited car draws."};

data = {"query": query, "variables": variables}

headers = {
  "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

url = "your_project_endpoint"

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print(response.json())
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)

    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    curl -X POST your_project_endpoint \  
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_api_key' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ 
      -d '{"query": " query ExecuteWorkflow(     $workflowId: String!  $prompt: String ) { executeWorkflow( workflowId: $workflowId  payload: { prompt: $prompt }  ) { status  result } }", "variables": {"workflowId":"your_workflow_id","prompt":"The excited car draws."}}'
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Output
The Structure output can be configured in the Schema of the Graphql Response node. The expected output will be as follows:
```
{
  // Expected Output as setuped in the Schema
}
```

In this example, the `ExecuteWorkflow` query is used to initiate a workflow execution. You'll need to provide the `workflowId` of the desired workflow and any required `payload`(Input Data) as part of the query variables.
