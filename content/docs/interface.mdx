# **Interfaces for Integrating AI Features**

Interfaces provide various options to seamlessly integrate and embed AI features into your application. These interfaces offer flexibility and power, allowing you to harness the full potential of AI within your project. Once your project is deployed, you can easily access the automatically generated setup documentation. This documentation is conveniently located within the flow or at the top bar of your project, ensuring you have all the necessary information at your fingertips.



## **Methods**

### **GraphQL API**

The GraphQL API enables both synchronous and asynchronous API requests. It uses a configurable schema for input and output responses, providing maximum flexibility. To use it, send a request to the API endpoint with a flowID. Our system manages the request queue and ensures timely, accurate resolution, letting you focus on your application logic.

### **Webhooks**

For third-party applications or services, webhooks offer a seamless solution for running asynchronous requests. Webhooks provide real-time updates and trigger actions based on specific events, automating processes across your application ecosystem. This integration allows for smooth interaction with external systems.

### **Widgets**

The widget solution allows for quick integration of Generative AI features into your website. With just a few lines of code, you can embed powerful AI capabilities into web pages. The pre-built widgets are user-friendly and designed to enhance your website’s functionality without extensive development work. Whether you’re adding chatbots, content generation, or other AI-powered features, these widgets make it simple to bring advanced AI to your users.
