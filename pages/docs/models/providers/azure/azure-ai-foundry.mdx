# Azure AI Foundry
Azure AI Foundry provides a unified platform for enterprise AI operations, model building, and application development. With Lamatic, you can seamlessly integrate with various models available on Azure AI Foundry and take advantage of features like observability, prompt management, fallbacks, and more.

Azure AI Foundry offers three different ways to deploy models, each with unique endpoints and configurations:
1. **AI Services**: Azure-managed models accessed through Azure AI Services endpoints
1. **Managed**: User-managed deployments running on dedicated Azure compute resources
1. **Serverless**: Seamless, scalable deployment without managing infrastructure
<br/>
