# Testing and Debugging

[Lamatic.ai](http://Lamatic.ai) provides a comprehensive suite of tools to test and debug your flow effectively. This documentation covers essential testing methods to optimize your flow's performance in production.


## Complete Flow Testing
![img.png](./img/testing.png)

Run a full flow test for end-to-end execution:

- **Execution:** Click the "Test" button to execute all nodes in sequence.
- **Progress Tracking:** Observe node-level progress during execution.
- **Output Review:** View the final output generated at the end of the flow.

## Trigger-Specific Testing Approaches

Different triggers require unique testing methods:

| **Trigger Type** | **Input Method**               | **Testing Procedure**                                                               |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API**          | Sample API request payload     | 1. Enter or choose the payload <br/> 2. Run the test                                |
| **Widget**       | Sample payload or interaction  | 1. Interact with the widget or enter/choose payload <br/> 2. Run the test           |
| **Webhook**      | Sample or actual webhook data  | 1. Send data to the specified webhook or enter/choose payload <br/> 2. Run the test |
| **App**          | Sample payload or event sim    | 1. Perform the desired trigger event or enter/choose payload <br/>  2. Run the test |



### Preview Test
For widget-triggered flows:

- **UI Preview:** Use the preview feature to visualize widget appearance and functionality.
- **Configuration Check:** Ensure interface elements are correctly set before deployment.


## Debug: Node-Level Testing

Lamatic Studio provides powerful tools to help developers debug and test their flows efficiently. Use the debug mode to simulate inputs, capture outputs, and iterate quickly.
<br/>
With Flow Debugging you can:

- **Save test cases** to reuse and iterate faster.
- **Inspect input, output, logs, and token usage** for each node in your flow.
- **View estimated token cost** per test run to manage expenses better.
- **Identify and fix issues precisely** ‚Äî no more guessing what went wrong.
<br/>
To begin testing your flows:

1. Go to your **Flow Editor**.
2. Click the **Debug** Button in the bottom right.
3. Enter your test input data (as JSON or plain text).
4. Hit **Run Test** to simulate execution.

<Callout emoji="üí°">
Each test run executes the full flow using your provided input, showing node-by-node progress and output.
</Callout>
<br/>
Each test execution visualizes:
- Node-by-node status (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- Real-time inputs & outputs
- Token usage breakdown

### Saving Test Cases
Click the plus (+) icon to add and save new test cases.

### To Save a Test Case:
1. Enter your input data.
2. Click the plus (+) icon
3. Give it a name (e.g., `User sign-up flow test`).

### To Reuse a Test Case:
- Select the saved test case from the **Saved Tests** dropdown and click **Run Test**.

### Debugging Output

After running a test:
- Each node will show a status: ‚úÖ Success, ‚ùå Error.
- Click on any node to inspect:
  - **Input received**
  - **Output generated**
  - **Execution time**
  - **Error messages** (if any)


## Code and Prompt Testing

Test specific components independently:

- **Code & Prompts:** Test code in a code node or prompts in any AI generator node.
- **Testing Button:** Click "Test" in the IDE to run the component. The system will prompt you to run prior nodes if needed to generate the output.



By following these methods and utilizing [Lamatic.ai](http://Lamatic.ai)'s testing tools, you can ensure your flow is robust, efficient, and ready for production deployment.
