## Low-Code Example

```yaml
nodes:
  - nodeId: searchNode_747
    nodeType: searchNode
    nodeName: Vector Search
    values:
      searchQuery: Tell me something about ${{triggerNode_1.output.topic}}
      vectorDB: ""
      certainty: "0.85"
      limit: "3"
      filters: "[]"
    needs:
      - triggerNode_1
  - nodeId: plus-node-addNode_670114
    nodeType: addNode
    nodeName: ""
    values: {}
    needs:
      - searchNode_747
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**                    | **Solution**                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Invalid API Key**            | Ensure the API key is correct and has not expired.           |
| **Dynamic Content Not Loaded** | Increase the `Wait for Page Load` time in the configuration. |

### Debugging

1. Check Lamatic Flow logs for error details.
1. Verify API Key.
