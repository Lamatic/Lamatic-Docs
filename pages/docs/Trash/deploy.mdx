Here are some of the key deployment options available on Lamatic.ai:

## GraphQL API

Lamatic.ai exposes a powerful GraphQL API that allows seamless integration with your existing applications or services. By deploying your flow as a GraphQL API, you can leverage the benefits of efficient data querying, real-time updates, and flexible data manipulation.

The GraphQL API deployment method is particularly useful when:

- Integrating your GenAI application with other systems or services
- Building frontends or client applications that require real-time data access
- Exposing your GenAI capabilities to external consumers or partners

## Edge Deployment

Edge computing brings processing power closer to the end-users, reducing latency and enhancing overall performance. Lamatic.ai leverages edge deployment to ensure that your GenAI applications are delivered with minimal delay, providing a seamless user experience.

Edge deployment is ideal when:

- Low latency is critical for your application's performance
- Serving users in geographically distributed locations
- Minimizing network congestion and reducing data transfer costs

## Cache

Caching is a powerful technique for improving application performance by storing frequently accessed data or computed results in memory. Lamatic.ai provides caching capabilities to optimize the delivery of your GenAI applications, reducing response times and improving overall scalability.

Caching is particularly beneficial when:

- Your application involves computationally intensive or time-consuming operations
- Serving frequently requested data or content
- Minimizing redundant computations and reducing server load

## Components

Lamatic.ai allows you to package and deploy your flows as reusable components. These components can be easily integrated into other applications or shared across different projects, promoting code reuse and collaboration.

Deploying your flows as components is advantageous when:

- Building modular and composable GenAI applications
- Sharing common functionality across multiple projects or teams
- Promoting code reusability and maintainability
