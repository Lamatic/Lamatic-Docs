  faq: [
    {
      question: "How accurate is the AI evaluation?",
      answer: "The system uses OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model for deep analysis, providing consistent and objective evaluations based on job requirements. All recommendations include detailed explanations.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize job categories and descriptions?",
      answer: "Yes, job categories and descriptions are fully customizable in lib/jobs-data.ts. You can add unlimited categories and jobs with custom requirements, locations, and types.",
    },
    {
      question: "What resume formats are supported?",
      answer: "The system supports PDF resumes, which are uploaded to Vercel Blob storage and analyzed by the AI. The resume URL is securely passed to the Lamatic workflow.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is candidate data stored?",
      answer: "Resume files are stored in Vercel Blob with secure URLs. Analysis results are processed in real-time and displayed to the user. No candidate data is permanently stored without your explicit implementation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I integrate this with my ATS?",
      answer: "Yes, the system is built with Next.js and can be extended to integrate with any ATS via API. The modular architecture makes it easy to add custom integrations.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the cost per candidate evaluation?",
      answer: "Costs depend on your Lamatic plan and AI model usage. The o3-mini model typically costs $0.005-0.01 per evaluation. Check the _meta field in responses for exact token costs.",
    },
