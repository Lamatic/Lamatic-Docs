# **Supervisor Node**

The **Supervisor Node** is a central agent that orchestrates multi-agent flow. It collects input, maintains structured memory, and coordinates with sub-agents based on predefined logic. This node ensures a seamless iterative process for dynamic AI-powered applications, including structured decision-making systems and task automation.

## **What Can I Build?**

- AI-powered personal assistants that dynamically route tasks across sub-agents.
- Multi-step flow for data collection, processing, and decision-making.
- Automated AI systems that require iterative questioning to refine responses.
- Intelligent customer support agents that engage in structured dialogues.


## **Setup**

### **Configuring the Supervisor Node**
1. Define the **Agent Paths** to specify branching logic.
2. Set up the **Prompt Template** to control AI responses.
3. Assign an **LLM Model** for text generation.
4. Configure **Stop Words** and **Iteration Limits** for loop control.

### **Deployment**
1. Integrate the Supervisor Node into the workflow.
2. Connect relevant agent nodes for branching execution.
3. Deploy the project and trigger workflow execution.

## Output

#### output
- A nested object containing the output generated by the Supervisor Node. This depends and modfies based on the 
paths and agents defined in the configuration.

### Example Output

```json
{
  “output”: {}
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**                    | **Solution**                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invalid API Key**            | Ensure the API key is correct and has not expired.                |
| **Dynamic Content Not Loaded** | Increase the `Wait for Page Load` time in the configuration.      |

### Debugging
1. Check Lamatic Flow logs for error details.
1. Verify API Key.
