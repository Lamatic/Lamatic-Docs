# Workflow Config

At Lamatic.ai, we understand that every GenAI application has unique requirements and complexities. To empower our users with the flexibility and control they need, we've introduced the Workflow Configuration feature, transforming our platform into a powerful Low Code, No Code solution.

## Workflow Config Editor (Code View)

Lamatic.ai's Workflow Config Editor( Code View ) is a game-changer for developers and power users alike. This intuitive code editor allows you to define and customize your entire workflow configuration using a simple yet expressive syntax.

It is a YAML based easy to understand syntax which defines the structure of the workflow. If you want to learn more about YAML syntax, you can refer to this instructional blog on it - [YAML Tutorial : A Complete Language Guide with Examples](https://spacelift.io/blog/yaml)


To enter into the code view of the workflow, click on the `Config` toggle on the top of the workflow editor. 
With a simple click, you can switch between the visual, no-code interface and the Workflow Config Code Editor, allowing you to choose the development approach that best suits your needs.

Let's understand the workflow config with the example from above:


**Code view for the workflow:**
```yaml
triggerNode:
  nodeId: 'triggerNode_1'
  nodeName: Graphql
  values:
    responseType: realtime
    advance_schema: |-
      {
        "Demo": "string"
      }
nodes:
  - nodeId: codeNode_esztukerjc
    nodeName: Code
    values:
      code: "const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\r\nconst filteredArr = arr.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);\r\noutput = {\r\n  \"filteredArr\": filteredArr\r\n}"
    needs:
      - 'triggerNode_1'
responseNode:
  nodeId: graphqlResponseNode_svs7l57hzm
  values:
    outputMapping: |-
      {
        "Demo": "output",
        "Demo3": "{{codeNode_esztukerjc.output}}"
      }
  needs:
    - codeNode_esztukerjc
```

Now, let's break down the example and explain each part.


#### Nodes

 A node is a basic building block of the workflow. It is a unit of execution that performs a specific task.
  It has the following structure:
The node has the following properties:

- `nodeId`: The unique identifier for the node.
- `nodeName`: The name of the node.
- `values`: These values are node specific and are used to configure the node.
- `needs`: This is an array of node ids that are needed by the current node. This is basically and array of node ids that are connected to the current node. The node with the id mentioned in the `needs` array will be executed first and its output will be passed to the current node.

### Trigger Node

```yaml
triggerNode:
  nodeId: 'triggerNode_1' 
  nodeName: Graphql
  values:
    responseType: realtime
    advance_schema: |-
      {
        "Demo": "string"
      }
```
  The `triggerNode` is the starting point of the workflow. It is the entry point of the workflow.
  The trigger node is a required node and must be present in the workflow.
  The trigger node will not have any `needs` property as it is the entry point of the workflow.

### Response Node

```yaml
responseNode:
  nodeId: graphqlResponseNode_svs7l57hzm
  values:
    outputMapping: |-
      {
        "Demo": "output",
        "Demo3": "{{codeNode_esztukerjc.output}}"
      }
```

The `responseNode` is the last node in the workflow. It is used to get the response from the workflow.
Now keep in mind that the response node is not a node that is required always. It depends mainly on the type of trigger node that you are using.

For example, if you are using a `Graphql` node as a trigger node, then you need to have a `Graphql Response Node` in your workflow to get the response from the workflow.
But if you are using a `Slack` node as a trigger node, then you do not need a `responseNode` in your workflow.

## Low Code, No Code, and Everything in Between

The Workflow Configuration feature solidifies Lamatic.ai's position as a true Low-Code/No-Code platform. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to harness the full power of code, or a non-technical user seeking a user-friendly, visual interface, Lamatic.ai has you covered.

For those preferring a no-code approach, our intuitive visual interface allows you to design and orchestrate your GenAI workflows without writing a single line of code. Conversely, developers can leverage the Workflow Configuration Code Editor to craft intricate and sophisticated workflows, tailored to their specific requirements.

Moreover, Lamatic.ai supports a seamless blend of both approaches, enabling you to combine the convenience of the visual interface with the power and flexibility of code, creating a truly hybrid development experience.
approach that best suits your needs, ensuring that your GenAI applications are tailored to perfection, without compromising on flexibility or control.
