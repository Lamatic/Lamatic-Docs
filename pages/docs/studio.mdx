# Workspaces

Studio allows you to create and customize workspaces that accurately reflect your organization's structure and workflow. These workspaces can accommodate different members and teams, providing a flexible environment for collaboration. Members have the freedom to be part of multiple workspaces and effortlessly switch between them as their projects and responsibilities require. For more precise control over access and permissions, you can establish Member Roles, ensuring that each team member has the appropriate level of access. It's important to note that all members within a workspace have access to all projects contained within that particular workspace, promoting transparency and collaboration.

## Inviting to Your Workspace

Expanding your workspace is a straightforward process. You can easily add new members by extending invitations through the organization settings. This feature is particularly useful for onboarding new team members or collaborators. If the invitee is not already a registered user of [Lamatic.ai](http://Lamatic.ai), they will receive a signup email, guiding them through the process of joining your workspace. Additionally, Studio provides the flexibility to manage your workspace membership by allowing you to remove members when necessary, ensuring that your workspace remains current and aligned with your project needs.

### Billing

Studio offers a centralized and transparent approach to billing management. Within the workspace, you have the ability to view and manage all billing information in one convenient location. This feature provides a comprehensive overview of your financial commitments and usage across projects. It's worth noting that Studio accommodates flexibility in project plans - different projects within the same workspace can operate on distinct plans tailored to their specific requirements. Despite this diversity in plans, Studio simplifies the billing process by allowing these projects to be billed together, streamlining your financial management and providing a clear picture of your overall investment in Lamatic's services.
