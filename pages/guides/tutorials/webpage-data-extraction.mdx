# Web Scraping and Q&A System With AI

This guide will help you build an AI-powered system that scrapes data from a website, processes it with AI, and allows users to ask questions based on the extracted information

## What You'll Build

A simple API that scrapes data from a website, processes it with AI, and enables users to ask questions based on the extracted information. When users input a query, the system retrieves relevant data from the scraped content and generates accurate, AI-driven responses, ensuring efficient and insightful information retrieval.

## Getting Started

### 1. Project Setup

1. Sign up at [Lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai/) and log in.
1. Navigate to the dashboard and click **Create New Flow**.
1. You'll see different sections like Flows, Data, and Models

### 2. Creating a New Flow

1. Navigate to Flows, select New Flow, and choose Create from Scratch as your starting point.
2. Click "New Flow"

3. Select "Create from Scratch"
   ![Flow Start](./img/ai-review-responder/flow-start.png)

### 3. Setting Up Your API

1. Click "Choose a Trigger"
2. Select "API Request" under the interface options
   ![Flow API](./img/ai-review-responder/flow-step2.png)
3. Configure your API:
   - Add your Input Schema
   - Set url and question as parameter in input schema
   - Set response type to "Real-time"
     ![Flow API Schema](./img/webpage-data-extractor/flow-api-schema.png)

### 4. Scraping the data using Firecrawl

1. Click the Scraper node
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/webpage-data-extractor/scraper-node.png)
2. Select the credentials
3. Add url as parameter

### 5. Adding AI Text Generation

1. Click the + icon to add a new node
2. Choose "Text LLM"
   ![Node Text Gen](./img/webpage-data-extractor/node-text-gen.png)
3. Configure the AI model:
   - Select your "Open AI" credentials
   - Choose "gpt-4o-mini" as your Model
4. Set up your prompt:

   ```
   Using the markdown content from {{scraperNode_211.output.markdown}},
   answer the following question: {{triggerNode_1.output.question}}.

   ```

- You can add variables using the "Add Variable" button

### 6. Configuring the reponse

1. Click the API response node
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/webpage-data-extractor/response-node.png)
2. Add Output Variables by clicking the + icon
3. Select variable from your Text LLM Node

### 7. Test the flow

1. Click on 'API Request' trigger node
2. Click on Configure test
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/webpage-data-extractor/testing.png)
3. Fill sample value in 'url' and 'question' and click on test

### 8. Deployment

1. Click the Deploy button
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/ai-review-responder/deploy.png)
2. Your API is now ready to be integrated into Node.js or Python applications
3. Your flow will run on Lamatic's global edge network for fast, scalable performance

### 9. What's Next?

- Experiment with different prompts
- Try other AI models
- Add more processing steps to your flow
- Integrate the API into your applications

### 10. Tips

- Save your tests for reuse across different scenarios
- Use consistent JSON structures for better maintainability
- Test thoroughly before deployment

Now you have a working AI-powered API! You can expand on this foundation to build more complex applications using Lamatic.ai's features.
