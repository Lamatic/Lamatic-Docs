# API Keys to Execute Deployed Workflows

At Lamatic.ai, we prioritize security and access control for your deployed GenAI workflows. To ensure that only authorized users can execute and interact with your workflows, we employ a robust API key system. These API keys serve as unique identifiers, granting you secure access to your deployed workflows while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of your data.

## Creating API Keys

Lamatic.ai empowers you to create and manage your own API keys directly from our platform. This process is straightforward and user-friendly, ensuring that you can easily generate new keys or revoke existing ones as needed.

To create a new API key, simply navigate to the "API Keys" section in your Lamatic.ai dashboard. From there, you can generate a unique key with just a few clicks. Each API key is associated with specific permissions and access levels, allowing you to granularly control the level of access granted to different users or applications.

## Updating Deployed Workflows with New API Keys

Whenever you create or update an API key, Lamatic.ai automatically updates the deployment of your GenAI workflows to ensure that they are using the latest authorized keys. This seamless integration ensures that your deployed workflows remain secure and accessible only to authorized parties.

By incorporating the new API key into your deployment, we guarantee that any attempt to execute or interact with your workflows without the proper key will be rejected, safeguarding your valuable GenAI applications from unauthorized access.
