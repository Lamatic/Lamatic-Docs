Hugging Face is a leading platform for building, hosting, and deploying state-of-the-art machine learning models. With its extensive model hub and flexible deployment options, Hugging Face allows you to use both public models and your own self-hosted endpoints. Lamatic.ai Studio enables seamless integration of these models, whether you use a managed public endpoint or a private, self-hosted endpoint for custom or fine-tuned models.
> **Lamatic.ai Studio supports both public (open-source) and private (self-hosted/dedicated) Hugging Face models.**  

> You can integrate popular models from the Hugging Face Hub or connect your own secure, fine-tuned endpoints for production use.

**Access Denied:**  
- Check your tokenâ€™s permissions and endpoint/model visibility.
- Make sure you have access to the deployed endpoint if using self-hosted.

**Model or Endpoint Not Found:**  
- Double-check the model name or endpoint URL.
- Confirm you have access to the model or endpoint.

**Rate Limit Exceeded:**  
- Wait before retrying requests.
