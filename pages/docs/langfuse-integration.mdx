## Tracing LLM Calls with Langfuse

At Lamatic.ai, we leverage Langfuse to trace every single LLM call made within our platform. This comprehensive tracing approach ensures that you have a complete and accurate record of all LLM interactions, including input prompts, output responses, processing times, and associated costs.

By capturing this valuable data, Langfuse enables you to:

1. **Monitor Performance**: Gain insights into the performance of your LLM interactions, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing response times.

2. **Analyze Costs**: Understand the cost implications of your LLM usage, enabling you to optimize resource allocation and control expenses.

3. **Inspect Outputs**: Review and inspect the outputs generated by LLMs, ensuring quality control and compliance with your business requirements.

4. **Identify Inefficiencies**: Pinpoint inefficient or redundant LLM calls, allowing you to streamline your workflows and reduce unnecessary computational overhead.
