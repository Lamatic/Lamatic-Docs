# LLM Prompting Techniques

## What are LLMs?
Large Language Models (like Claude) are AI systems that understand and generate text. How you ask questions matters a lot for getting good answers!

## Effective Ways to Talk to AI

### 1. Direct Questions (Zero-Shot)
Just ask plainly what you want.

**Example:**
```
Summarize this paragraph about climate change: [your text here]
```

### 2. Show Examples First (Few-Shot)
Give examples of what you want before asking.

**Example:**
```
Change these to past tense:

"I walk" → "I walked"
"She runs" → "She ran"

Now change: "They build sandcastles"
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Thinking (Chain-of-Thought)
Ask the AI to solve problems one step at a time.

**Example:**
```
If a $50 shirt is 30% off, then has another 15% discount, what's the final price? Think step by step.
```

### 4. Multiple Solutions Approach
Ask for several answers to pick the best one.

**Example:**
```
Solve this math problem three different ways, then tell me which is right: [problem]
```

### 5. Role-Playing
Ask the AI to pretend to be someone specific.

**Example:**
```
As an experienced data scientist, explain how to handle imbalanced datasets to a beginner.
```

### 6. Using Templates
Create a fill-in-the-blank structure.

**Example:**
```
Article Title: [topic]
Audience: [who]
Tone: [style]
Word Count: [length]

Write a blog post following this plan.
```

### 7. Clear Instructions
Give numbered or step-by-step directions.

**Example:**
```
Write a product description for headphones. Please:
1. Start with a catchy headline
2. List 3-5 key features
3. End with a call-to-action
4. Keep it under 200 words
```

### 8. Define Who's Talking to Who
Set up both the AI's role and the audience.

**Example:**
```
You're a financial advisor talking to a 28-year-old who just got promoted. Give them financial advice.
```

### 9. Set Clear Boundaries
Define what you do and don't want.

**Example:**
```
Write a short story about friendship with these rules:
- Max 250 words
- Post-apocalyptic setting
- No human characters
- End on a positive note
```

### 10. Request Specific Formats
Ask for information organized in a particular way.

**Example:**
```
Analyze renewable energy and present it like this:

Introduction: (brief overview)

Strengths:
- [point 1]
- [point 2]

Weaknesses:
- [point 1]
- [point 2]

Conclusion: (summary)
```
