# Chunking Node
<NodeOverview slug="chunking-node"/>

## Overview

The Chunking node is a tool designed to parse data into manageable chunks to facilitate vectorization and semantic retrieval. By breaking text into smaller, logical units, it prepares the data for more efficient processing and analysis. This node can be configured to use specific chunking methodologies and separators, ensuring that the text is divided in a way that maintains context and relevance. Lamatic.ai provides this functionality as part of its suite of tools to enhance data processing and streamline flow, making it easier for users to manage large datasets and extract meaningful insights.

| **Chunking Type**          | Choose the method to split the text into chunks. <br/><br/> `Recursive Character Text Splitter` method splits text into smaller chunks while preserving as much context as possible. It works by recursively breaking down the text, starting with larger logical units like paragraphs, then sentences, and so on, until the desired chunk size is achieved. This approach is ideal for use cases where maintaining coherence within chunks is important, such as natural language processing or document indexing. <br/><br/> `Character Text Splitter` is a simpler method that divides text into chunks based on a fixed number of characters. It does not consider the structure of the text, such as paragraphs or sentences, and while it is faster and easier to implement, it may cut off sentences or disrupt the logical flow of the text. | Yes          | `Recursive Character Text Splitter` |

## Low-Code Example

```yaml
nodes:
  - nodeId: chunkNode_262
    nodeType: chunkNode
    nodeName: chunking
    values:
      chunkField: "{{triggerNode_1.output.content}}"
      numOfChars: 200
      separators:
        - \n\n
        - \n
        - " "
      chunkingType: recursiveCharacterTextSplitter
      overlapChars: "20"
    needs:
      - triggerNode_1
```

## Output

#### `chunks`

#### `lines`
- A nested object indicating the line range of the chunk in the source document.

#### `from`
- The starting line number of the chunk.

#### `to`
- The ending line number of the chunk.

### Example Output

```json
{
    "chunks": [
      {
        "pageContent": "LLM transformers, like GPT and BERT, use self-attention mechanisms to process and generate human-like text efficiently across various natural language tasks.",
