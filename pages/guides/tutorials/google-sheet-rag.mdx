# Getting started with google sheets

This guide will help you build an AI-powered system that fetches data from a Google Sheet using a Google Sheet node and passes it to an LLM node to answer user queries. By integrating structured data with AI, this system enables seamless retrieval of relevant information, making it easier to generate insightful responses based on the stored data.

## What you'll Build


- A chatbot using Lamatic.ai Studio
- A chat system powered by an LLM
- Integration of a Google Sheet node for dynamic data retrieval
- Seamless question-answering based on structured data
