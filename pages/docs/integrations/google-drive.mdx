## Features

### ✅ Key Functionalities
- **Batch Trigger**: Automates file fetching and synchronization on a schedule.
- **File Type Support**: Handles Google Docs, Slides, Word Documents, PDFs, and text files.

### ✅ Benefits
- Streamlines file collection from Google Drive.
- Prepares files for vectorization and indexing to enhance RAG flows.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Google Drive node, ensure you have the following:
- Google Drive credentials for accessing the desired folder.
- The target folder URL from Google Drive.
- An understanding of Cron expressions for scheduling flows.

## Installation

### Step 1: Set Up Lamatic Flow
1. **Create a Custom Flow**:
   - Follow the [webhook integration guide](https://lamatic.ai/docs/interface/webhooks).
   - Configure webhooks as trigger events.
   - Define custom actions for incoming webhook data.
2. **Use Pre-built Templates**:
   - Start with a [webhook template](https://hub.lamatic.ai/templates/index-from-github).
   - Customize the template as needed.

### Step 2: Configure Node in Lamatic
1. Add the Google Drive node to your flow.
2. Provide necessary credentials and folder details.
3. Schedule the flow using a Cron expression for regular execution.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**               | **Solution**                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Invalid Credentials**   | Verify that the correct Google Drive credentials are provided.                               |
| **Folder Not Found**      | Ensure the folder URL is accurate and accessible.                                           |
| **Sync Not Working**      | Check the Cron expression for correctness.                                                  |
| **File Types Unsupported**| Confirm that the files in the folder are of supported types (Google Docs, PDFs, etc.).      |

### Debugging

- Check Lamatic Flow logs for error details.
- Verify Google Drive API access permissions.
- Test the folder URL to ensure it’s valid and accessible.
