# N8N Node Documentation

The N8N node in Lamatic enables bidirectional integration between Lamatic and N8N platforms. This node supports both triggering N8N flow from Lamatic and executing Lamatic flows from N8N, providing flexible automation capabilities.

## Features

### ✅ Key Functionalities
- **Bidirectional Integration**: Supports both N8N to Lamatic and Lamatic to N8N flow.
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple dropdown-based workflow selection.
- **Webhook Support**: Built-in webhook handling for seamless communication.

### ✅ Benefits
- Combines N8N's workflow automation with Lamatic's Gen AI capabilities.
- Maintains existing N8N flow while adding AI functionality.
- Enables highly configurable cross-platform automation.


## Prerequisites

Before setting up the N8N node, ensure you have the following:

- **Setup N8N**: Choose your preferred option to get started.  
  - **Cloud (Price)**: Use the hosted version with its associated pricing plan.  
  - **Community Edition (Self Hosted)**: Install and run N8N on your own server for free.  

- **Install N8N Lamatic Module**: Add the Lamatic integration to your N8N setup.

  - **Define Credentials**:  
    - Select the **Webhook created in N8N** to link the two systems.
## Low-Code Example

```js
// Trigger Lamatic from N8N 
triggerNode:
  nodeId: triggerNode_1
  nodeType: n8nTriggerNode
  nodeName: N8N Trigger
  values:
    advance_schema: '{}'
    credentials: your credential name
    workflowId: your n8n workflow id which is linked to this node

// Trigger N8N from Lamatic
nodes:
  - nodeId: n8nNode_716
    nodeType: n8nNode
    nodeName: N8N
    values:
      credentials: your credential name
      workflowId:  your n8n workflow id which is linked to this node
      webhookPath: Auto Fetched Non Configurable Webhook Path
    needs:
      - triggerNode_1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**                | **Solution**                                                                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Connection Failure**     | Verify N8N Host URL and API credentials are correct.                                       |
| **Webhook Issues**         | Check if webhooks are properly configured and accessible.                                  |
| **Workflow Not Found**     | Ensure workflow IDs are correct and flow are active.                                  |
| **Response Timeout**       | Verify network connectivity and increase timeout settings if needed.                       |

### Debugging

- Check Lamatic Flow logs for error details.
- Verify N8N workflow status and triggers.
- Test webhook endpoints for accessibility.
- Confirm credential permissions and API access.
