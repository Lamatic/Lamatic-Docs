# JSON Generate Node Documentation

The JSON Generate node is used to produce structured JSON outputs from language model (LLM) prompts. It allows users to define a specific output schema, ensuring consistency and precision in data formatting for various applications. 


The node is part of a larger workflow system, enabling seamless integration with other processes and providing a streamlined setup experience for developers. This functionality is particularly useful in contexts where structured data is needed from natural language inputs, such as generating recipes or other content where specific data fields are required.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**                    | **Solution**                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Invalid API Key**            | Ensure the API key is correct and has not expired.           |
| **Dynamic Content Not Loaded** | Increase the `Wait for Page Load` time in the configuration. |

### Debugging

1. Check Lamatic Flow logs for error details.
1. Verify API Key.
