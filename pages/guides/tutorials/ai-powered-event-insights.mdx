# AI Powered Event Insights

This guide will walk you through building an AI-powered event data processing system. The workflow collects event data, passes it to a text generation node, and enables users to ask questions to receive AI-generated insights. This system allows for efficient event analysis and real-time information retrieval.

## What You'll Build

A simple API that processes event data, passes it to a text generation node, and enables users to ask questions for AI-generated insights. This API enhances event analysis by providing quick and accurate responses, enabling seamless integration with automation and decision-making flow.

## Getting Started

### 1. Project Setup

1. Sign up at [Lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai/) and log in.
1. Navigate to the Projects and click **New Project** or select your desired project.
1. You'll see different sections like Flows, Context, and Connections

### 2. Creating a New Flow

1. Navigate to Flows, select New Flow.
2. Click **Create from scratch** as starting point.
   ![Flow selection](./img/ai-review-responder/flow-start.png)

### 3. Setting Up Your API

1. Click "Choose a Trigger"
2. Select "API Request" under the interface options
   ![Flow API](./img/ai-review-responder/flow-step2.png)
3. Configure your API:
   - Add your Input Schema
   - Set url and question as parameter in input schema
   - Set response type to "Real-time"
   - Click on save

### 4. File Extraxt Node Addition

1. In the Next Node, select **Extract From File Node**
   1. Enter the File URL.
   1. Select Format as  per your requirement.

### 5. Adding AI Text Generation

1. Click the + icon to add a new node.
2. Choose **Generate Text**.

3. Configure the AI model:
   - Select your "Open AI" credentials
   - Choose "gpt-4-turbo" as your Model
4. Click on "+" under Prompts section.
5. Set up your prompt:

```

Use this data from an event and answer the question.
Data:{{extractFromFileNode_813.output.files}}
Question:{{triggerNode_1.output.question}}

```

- You can add variables using the "insert Variable" button

### 6. Configuring the reponse

1. Click the API response node.
2. Add Output Variables by clicking the + icon.
3. Select variable from your Generate Text Node.

### 7. Test the flow

1. Click on 'API Request' trigger node.
2. Click on Configure test.

3. Fill sample value in 'url','question' and click on test.

### 8. Deployment

1. Click the Deploy button.
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/ai-review-responder/deploy.png)
2. Your API is now ready to be integrated into Node.js or Python applications.
3. Your flow will run on Lamatic's global edge network for fast, scalable performance.

### 9. What's Next?

- Experiment with different prompts
- Try other AI models
- Add more processing steps to your flow
- Integrate the API into your applications

### 10. Tips

- Save your tests for reuse across different scenarios
- Use consistent JSON structures for better maintainability
- Test thoroughly before deployment

Now you have a working AI-powered API! You can expand on this foundation to build more complex applications using Lamatic.ai's features.
