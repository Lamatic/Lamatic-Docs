# Powerful Knowledge Chatbot with Firecrawl and RAG

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a custom knowledge chatbot using Lamatic.ai, Firecrawl, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

## What you'll Build
- You'll utilize Lamatic.ai Studio.
- Build Chat Widget using LLM
- Implement RAG & Firecrawl

## Understanding the Components
Before we dive in, let’s understand the key technologies we’ll be working with:

- **[Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/)** A web crawling service that systematically browses and collects website data. It can extract structured content, follow links, and handle various content types.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: A technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing relevant context retrieved from a knowledge base. This allows the model to generate more accurate and contextual responses.

## Architecture Overview
Our implementation follows a three-flow architecture, each handling a specific aspect of the system:

### 1. Firecrawl Flow
This flow is responsible for:
1. Accepting website URLs through an API endpoint
1. Configuring crawling parameters and depth
1. Extracting relevant content from web pages
1. Forwarding collected data to the webhook flow

### 2. Webhook Processing Flow
This flow handles:
1. Receiving crawled data from Firecrawl
1. Cleaning and processing the text content
1. Creating vector embeddings for efficient retrieval
1. Storing processed data in a vector database

### 3. Chatbot Flow
This flow manages:
1. User interaction through a chat interface
1. Context retrieval using RAG
1. Response generation using the LLM
1. Handling edge cases and errors

## Getting Started

<Steps>
### 1. Project Setup
1. Visit [Lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai/) and sign in
2. Create a new organization
3. Create a project within your organization
