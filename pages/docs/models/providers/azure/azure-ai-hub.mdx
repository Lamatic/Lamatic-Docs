# Azure AI Hub
Azure AI Hub provides enterprise-grade resource management for collaborative AI development teams. It offers shared configurations, centralized security settings, and advanced networking capabilities. With Lamatic, you can seamlessly integrate with models deployed through Azure AI Hub and take advantage of features like observability, prompt management, fallbacks, and more.

Learn how to integrate Azure AI Hub with Portkey to access a wide range of AI models with enhanced observability and reliability features for enterprise environments.
<br/>
Azure AI Hub offers three different deployment types through hub-based projects:
1. **Hub Resources**: Centralized management of compute, storage, and networking
2. **Shared Projects**: Multiple projects sharing hub configurations and resources  
3. **Enterprise Security**: Advanced networking, private endpoints, and compliance features
<br/>
