# AI Candidate Screener Guide

> This guide will help you build an AI-powered GitHub profile screening system using Lamatic.ai's flow builder. The system can automatically analyze candidates' GitHub repositories, match their experience and skills against job requirements, and generate personalized email responses - either congratulating qualified candidates for advancing to the next round or providing constructive feedback to those who didn't meet the criteria.

### 17. Set up the prompt with your JD and Candidate Info

Write a prompt as per your needs by mentioning your JD and the candidate's GitHub info, which we obtained by using the execute flow node calling the scraper flow that we previously created.

Sample Prompt:

```
The candidate has filled the about you and why you section for a job recruitment with job description as follows To recruit the best candidates for the Next.js developer’s role, it is vital to adequately list the required experience and duties. The expectations for the given position may vary, as they may be expanded depending on the role, in other words, entry-level, mid-level, or senior Next.js developer’s position. Thus, a precise enumeration of job responsibilities and qualifications will help ensure that the applicants meet the job requirements for the Next.js developer role to a greater extent.

As a Next.JS developer, your responsibilities will be:

Creating high-performance web applications and maintaining them.
Designing server-side rendered React applications and implementing optimized client-side rendering.
Effective integration with APIs and various databases.
Write clean and efficient code.
Coordinate activities with cross-functional teams for efficient user experiences.
Possesses problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of JavaScript and React framework.

Scraping the github of candidate we got : {{flowNode_802.output.flowOutput.markdown}}
The candidate has also filled following details about himself :{{triggerNode_1.output.aboutYou}}
Based on this details and job description classify whether the candidate is potential candidate or not at the moment

```

### 19. Select Credential for Text Generate and write Prompt based on classification

Sample prompt for Potential Candidate:

```
Generate a personalzied email for {{triggerNode_1.output.email}} telling him that he alligs with our jd and we liked his github Profile
