# Data Nodes

The Data nodes represent the fuel injection system for these powerful AI engines you're constructing. They allow you to refine, structure, and harmonize your data into the optimal form, for your workflow.

## Refining Your Data Delicacies

Some of the key nodes in your data preparation pantry include:

### Chunking Node
Divide and organize large data files into optimally sized portions or chunks for efficient parallel processing and model serving.

### Index Node
Generate intelligent data indexes that can accelerate searches, queries, and retrieval over your corpora of documents and knowledge bases.

### Read File Node
Expand your data palette by ingesting files from local storage or repositories across various formats - documents, images, audio/video and more.

### Vectorize Node
Transform data into high-dimensional vector representations using the latest embedding techniques, enabling complex similarity calculations and semantic search capabilities.  

### Convert Node
Harmonize disparate data formats by converting between structures like JSON, XML, CSV, SQL, etc. to establish a unified data shape and flow.

### Parser Node
For unstructured data sources, automatically extract and parse out key elements like entities, tables, text segments, and semantic elements.
