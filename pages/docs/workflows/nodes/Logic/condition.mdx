# Condition

Implement intelligent control flows, branching your 
pipelines based on dynamic conditions, data filters, 
and rules.

``` mermaid

    participant User
    participant System
    participant ConditionEvaluator
    participant Pipeline

    User->>System: Initiate Process
    loop Check Dynamic Conditions
        System->>ConditionEvaluator: Evaluate Dynamic Conditions
        ConditionEvaluator->>System: Conditions Met?
    end

    alt Conditions Met
        System->>Pipeline: Execute Pipeline
    else Conditions Not Met
        System->>User: Provide Feedback or Error
    end

    opt Apply Data Filters
        System->>Pipeline: Apply Data Filters
    end

    loop Evaluate Rules
        System->>Pipeline: Evaluate Rules
    end

    System-->>User: Process Complete
```
## Example Usage

To use the `Condition` node in your workflow, follow these steps:

1. Define your dynamic conditions, data filters, and rules.
2. Initialize the `Condition` node in your workflow.
3. Loop through the dynamic conditions and evaluate them using the `ConditionEvaluator`.
4. If the conditions are met, execute the pipeline.
5. If the conditions are not met, provide feedback or an error message to the user.
6. Apply data filters to the pipeline if necessary.
7. Evaluate the rules within the pipeline.
8. Once the process is complete, notify the user.

Here's an example of how the code would look like:
