# Integrations

Integrations allow you to connect Lamatic with third-party applications and services. Use integration nodes to enable data exchange and action execution between Lamatic and external services.

## Available Integrations

Lamatic provides a wide range of integration nodes that act as bridges to external services:

- **Communication**: Slack, Twilio, SMTP
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Airtable
- **Storage**: Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint, S3
- **Productivity**: Notion, Google Sheets
- **Automation**: N8N
- **Web**: Web Search, Scraper, Crawler

## Using Integration Nodes

Integration nodes are available in the **Apps** category when building flows. Each integration node provides specific actions and triggers for interacting with the connected service.

For a complete list of available nodes, see the [Nodes documentation](/docs/nodes).
