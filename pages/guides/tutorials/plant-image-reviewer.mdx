# Plant Care With AI

This guide will help you build an AI-powered plant identification system. The system processes image links provided by users, identifies plants in the images, and generates a structured output. Each identified plant includes its name, care instructions, and key details, providing a seamless way to analyze and extract meaningful data from images.

## What You'll Build

A simple API that processes image links provided by users, identifies plants in the images, and generates a structured output. Each identified plant includes its name, care instructions, and essential details. This API enables seamless extraction of meaningful data from images, ensuring efficient and accurate plant identification for a wide range of applications.

## Getting Started

### 1. Project Setup

1. Sign up at [Lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai/) and log in.
1. Navigate to the Projects and click **New Project** or select your desired project.
1. You'll see different sections like Flows, Context, and Connections

### 2. Creating a New Flow

1. Navigate to Flows, select New Flow.
2. Click **Create from scratch** as starting point.
   ![Flow selection](./img/ai-review-responder/flow-start.png)

### 3. Setting Up Your API

1. Click "Choose a Trigger"
2. Select "API Request" under the interface options
   ![Flow API](./img/ai-review-responder/flow-step2.png)
3. Configure your API:
   - Add your Input Schema
   - Set url as parameter in input schema
   - Set response type to "Real-time"
     ![Flow API Schema](./img/ai-article-summarizer/api-schema.png)
   - Click on save

### 4. Adding AI Text Generation

1. Click the + icon to add a new node
2. Choose "Generate Text"
   ![Node Text Gen](./img/ai-currency-converter/text-gen-node1.png)
3. Configure the AI model:
   - Select your "Gemini" credentials
   - Choose "gemini-1.5-pro-latest" as your Model
4. Under prompts section click the + icon to add prompt
5. Set up your prompt:

   ```
   Analyze the plant image provided at the URL:{{triggerNode_1.output.url}} and generate a strictly formatted JSON response for its care guide.

   Instructions:
   Precision: Use exact keys from the structure above. Replace placeholder strings (e.g., "symptom1") with actual data.
   Completeness: Include all sections even if some fields are "N/A".
   Validation: Ensure valid JSON syntax (escape quotes, avoid trailing commas).
   Clarity: Prioritize concise, actionable advice for beginners.
   Ambiguity Handling: If species is unclear, populate the "error" field with a request for more details (e.g., leaf shape, flower color).

   ```

- You can add variables using the "insert Variable" button

### 5. Configuring the reponse

1. Click the API response node
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/image-description-generator/flow-api-schema.png)
2. Add Output Variables by clicking the + icon
3. Select variable from your Generate Text Node

### 7. Test the flow

1. Click on 'API Request' trigger node
2. Click on Configure test
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/ai-image-reviewer/testing.png)
3. Fill sample value in 'url' and click on test

### 8. Deployment

1. Click the Deploy button
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/ai-review-responder/deploy.png)
2. Your API is now ready to be integrated into Node.js or Python applications
3. Your flow will run on Lamatic's global edge network for fast, scalable performance

### 9. What's Next?

- Experiment with different prompts
- Try other AI models
- Add more processing steps to your flow
- Integrate the API into your applications

### 10. Tips

- Save your tests for reuse across different scenarios
- Use consistent JSON structures for better maintainability
- Test thoroughly before deployment

Now you have a working AI-powered API! You can expand on this foundation to build more complex applications using Lamatic.ai's features.
