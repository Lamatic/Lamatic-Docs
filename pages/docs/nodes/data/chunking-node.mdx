# Chunking Node
<NodeOverview slug="chunking-node" type="data" />

## Overview

The Chunking Node is a data processing component that breaks down large text documents into smaller, manageable chunks. This is essential for processing large documents with AI models that have token limits, enabling efficient text analysis and processing.

| **Chunking Type**          | Choose the method to split the text into chunks. <br/><br/> `Recursive Character Text Splitter` method splits text into smaller chunks while preserving as much context as possible. It works by recursively breaking down the text, starting with larger logical units like paragraphs, then sentences, and so on, until the desired chunk size is achieved. This approach is ideal for use cases where maintaining coherence within chunks is important, such as natural language processing or document indexing. <br/><br/> `Character Text Splitter` is a simpler method that divides text into chunks based on a fixed number of characters. It does not consider the structure of the text, such as paragraphs or sentences, and while it is faster and easier to implement, it may cut off sentences or disrupt the logical flow of the text. | Yes          | `Recursive Character Text Splitter` |
