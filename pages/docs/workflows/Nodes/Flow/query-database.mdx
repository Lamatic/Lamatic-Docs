## Query Database Flow

To query a database in your workflow, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initiate Query**: The user initiates the query process by triggering the `Initiate Query` action.

2. **Connect to Database**: The system connects to the database repository to access the required data.

3. **Execute Query**: The system executes the query to retrieve the relevant data from the database.

4. **Enhance AI Outputs**: The system enhances the AI outputs by incorporating the database context and signals into the analysis.

5. **Provide Enhanced AI Outputs**: The system provides the enhanced AI outputs to the user for further processing or analysis.

By tapping into your database repositories, you can enrich your AI models with real-world data and improve the accuracy and relevance of your AI-powered applications.
