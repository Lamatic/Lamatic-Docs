# Vibe Coding Tools Setup Guide

This guide explains how to configure your development environment to work effectively with LLM-powered coding assistants ("Vibe Coding tools") using the project's dedicated context file (`llm.txt`). This helps AI models provide meaningful, context-aware suggestions by focusing on relevant parts of the repository.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Make sure you have your preferred Vibe Coding tool installed (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor).
- Ensure your local environment meets the Lamatic Docs system requirements: **Node.js 18+** and **Git**.

## 2. The LLM Context File (`llm.txt`)

- Located at the root of the repository, `llm.txt` lists essential source code and documentation directories to help LLM tools understand the project structure.
- This file improves AI suggestion quality by preventing unnecessary files (like build directories) from overwhelming the model.

## 3. Tool Setup and Integration

- Most modern Vibe Coding tools automatically detect and honor the `llm.txt` file if present at the root.
- To verify:

  1. Check the tool's documentation for repository context support.
  2. Ensure your tool is updated to the latest version.
  3. If needed, manually set the context root to the repository base where `llm.txt` resides.

## 4. Example Usage and Best Practices

| Task               | Bad Prompt                                  | Good Prompt (Context-Aware)                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Component Creation** | "Write a new button component."             | "Using the structure of `components/ui/button.tsx`, create a React `Badge` component with `variant='secondary'`."|
| **Logic Implementation**| "How to pass props to the new section?"    | "Looking at the `HeroSection.tsx` component, how should I pass `title` and `description` as props?" |

## 5. Troubleshooting

| Problem                | Solution                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Outdated Suggestions**| Clear your local AI cache for the project and keep your IDE extensions updated.                  |
| **Syntax Errors**       | Run the projectâ€™s formatter/linter (`npm run format`) to align your code to project style.       |
