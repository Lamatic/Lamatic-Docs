# Index Node Documentation

The Index node inserts records into a vector database, enabling fast semantic retrieval. This node is part of a larger workflow that allows users to manage and configure the indexing of data, including vectors and metadata, into a specified vector database. By configuring various parameters such as the vector database, metadata fields, and embedding models, users can tailor the indexing process to their specific needs.

## Configuration Reference

| **Parameter**           | **Description**                                                        | **Required** | **Example Value**                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Vector DB**           | Select the vector database where the vectors will be indexed.          | Yes          | `database`                        |
| **Vectors**             | Enter the vector data to be indexed in the database.                   | Yes          | `{{codeNode_540.output.vectors}}` |
| **Metadata**            | Include additional information to enhance vector search and retrieval. | Yes          | `{{codeNode_540.output.vectors}}` |
| **Primary Keys (JSON)** | Provide unique identifiers for each vector in JSON format.             | Yes          | []                                |
| **Duplication Records** | Manage duplicates by choosing to `overwrite` or `skip` them.           | No           | `overwrite`                       |

## Low-Code Example

```yaml
- nodeId: IndexNode_543
    nodeType: IndexNode
    nodeName: Index to DB
    values:
      vectorDB: IndexCrawler
      webhookURL: https://webhook.site/685a66e7-b4d3-40a4-9801-99e3460414f9
      primaryKeys: ''
      vectorsField: '{{codeNode_540.output.vectors}}'
      metadataField: '{{codeNode_540.output.metadata}}'
      duplicateOperation: overwrite
      embeddingModelName: {}
      generativeModelName:
        type: embedder/text
        nodeId: IndexNode
        model_name: text-embedding-ada-002
        provider_name: openai
    needs:
      - codeNode_540
```

## Sample Output

```json
 {
    "recordsIndexed": 1,
    "duplicateRecordsDeleted": 0,
    "message": "Data indexed successfully"
  }
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**                    | **Solution**                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invalid Database**           | Ensure the database is correct.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Dynamic Content Not Loaded** | Increase the `Wait for Page Load` time in the configuration.                                                                                                                                  |
| **ID Column Usage**            | Avoid using a column named "id" as IDs are reserved in the vector store. Using it will cause issues when building a vector.                                                                   |
| **Data Type Changes**          | Do not change the data type of indexed data. For example, if the "index size" metadata is indexed as a Number, changing it to a String in subsequent indexing attempts will result in errors. |

### Debugging

1. Check Lamatic Flow logs for error details.
