### Low-Code Example

```js
// Trigger Lamatic from N8N 
triggerNode:
  nodeId: triggerNode_1
  nodeType: n8nTriggerNode
  nodeName: N8N Trigger
  values:
    advance_schema: '{}'
    credentials: your credential name
    workflowId: your n8n workflow id which is linked to this node

// Trigger N8N from Lamatic
nodes:
  - nodeId: n8nNode_716
    nodeType: n8nNode
    nodeName: N8N
    values:
      credentials: your credential name
      workflowId:  your n8n workflow id which is linked to this node
      webhookPath: Auto Fetched Non Configurable Webhook Path
    needs:
      - triggerNode_1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**                | **Solution**                                                                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Connection Failure**     | Verify N8N Host URL and API credentials are correct.                                       |
| **Webhook Issues**         | Check if webhooks are properly configured and accessible.                                  |
| **Workflow Not Found**     | Ensure workflow IDs are correct and workflows are active.                                  |
| **Response Timeout**       | Verify network connectivity and increase timeout settings if needed.                       |

### Debugging

- Check Lamatic Flow logs for error details.
- Verify N8N workflow status and triggers.
