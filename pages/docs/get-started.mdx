# Quickstart Guide

This guide helps you go from **zero → deployed Lamatic project** and test it end-to-end.

## What you’ll learn

- How to create a project and build your first Flow
- How to test a Flow in Studio
- How to deploy so your Flow is accessible from integrations (API / widget / apps)

## Prerequisites

- A Lamatic account: [lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai/)
- Basic understanding: a **Flow** is a set of connected **Nodes** that run in order
- Optional (recommended): pick a Template to move faster

If you’re brand new, start with a template first. You can always customize it later.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(60.88541666666667% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%",
  }}

    title="Lamatic.ai | Studio"
    loading="lazy"
    allowFullScreen
    allow="clipboard-write"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light",
    }}
  />
</div>

<Steps>
The quickest way to get started is using a **pre-built template**, then editing it to fit your use case.

### Create (or pick) a Project

1. Open Studio (you’ll land on your dashboard).
2. Create a new Project (or open an existing one).

> Tip: Each Project is isolated — it has its own settings, credentials, and deployments.

### Select a Template

1. Go to **Templates**.
2. Pick a template that matches your goal (API, chatbot, RAG, automation).
3. Add it to your Project.

If you prefer starting from scratch, you can create a new Flow directly from the **Flows** section.

### Configure the Nodes (make it run)

1. Open the Flow in the **Editor**.
2. Click each Node and fill required fields (you’ll usually configure):
   - Model/provider credentials (for AI Nodes)
   - App connections (for Apps Nodes like Slack / Postgres)
   - Inputs and payload fields (what your Flow consumes)

### Test the Flow

1. Click **Test** in the Editor.
2. Provide sample inputs (if your trigger expects them).
3. Verify outputs at the final node (Response) and check logs if anything fails.

### Deploy the Project

Deployment makes your latest Flow changes available for integrations.

1. Click **Deploy**.
2. Wait for deployment to finish.
3. Copy the integration details from Studio (endpoint / keys / ids) as needed.

</Steps>

## Common beginner mistakes (and how to avoid them)

- **Forgetting to deploy**: If you updated keys, variables, or a Flow, deploy so changes take effect.
- **Missing credentials**: Many nodes require a model/API connection. Check the node config panel for required fields.
- **Payload mismatch**: Ensure your input payload matches what your trigger and nodes expect (field names + types).
