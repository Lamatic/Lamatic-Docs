# Flow Config

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    **We are improving Flow Config** <br/>
    We are currently working on improving Config and its docs, information here might be outdated.

At Lamatic.ai, we understand that every GenAI application has unique requirements and complexities. To empower our users with the flexibility and control they need, we've introduced the Flow Configuration feature, transforming our platform into a powerful Low Code, No Code solution.

## Flow Config Editor (Code View)

Lamatic.ai's Flow Config Editor( Code View ) is a game-changer for developers and power users alike. This intuitive code editor allows you to define and customize your entire Flow configuration using a simple yet expressive syntax.
It is a combination of `nodes` and `edges`. 

The nodes represent the different components of the Flow, while the edges define the connections between these components.
To enter into the code view of the Flow, click on the `Code View` toggle on the top of the Flow editor. 

With a simple click, you can switch between the visual, no-code interface and the Flow Config Code Editor, allowing you to choose the development approach that best suits your needs.

Let's understand the Flow config with an example:

**Example Flow**

**Code view for the Flow:**
```json
{
  "nodes": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "data": {
                "name": "TriggerNode"
            },
            "type": "TriggerNode",
            "width": 240,
            "height": 107,
            "position": {
                "x": 0,
                "y": 0
            },
            "sourcePosition": "bottom",
            "targetPosition": "top"
        },
        {
            "id": "3",
            "data": {
                "label": "something"
            },
            "type": "OutputNode",
            "width": 240,
            "height": 107,
            "dragging": false,
            "position": {
                "x": 0,
                "y": 1200
            },
            "selected": false,
            "sourcePosition": "bottom",
            "targetPosition": "top",
            "positionAbsolute": {
                "x": 460.9596029374933,
                "y": 1211.7389417936542
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "dndnode_0",
            "data": {
                "label": "dynamicNode node",
                "nodeId": "LLMNode",
                "values": {
                    "nodeName": "LLM",
                    "promptTemplate": "You are an expert Technical Blog Writer. Write a blog on the topic ${Flow['start']['input']}.",
                    "generativeModelName": "gpt-4o"
                }
            },
            "type": "dynamicNode",
            "width": 240,
            "height": 69,
            "dragging": false,
            "position": {
                "x": 676.8417187504645,
                "y": 242.5268006375551
            },
            "selected": false
        }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
            "id": "reactflow__edge-1-dndnode_0",
            "type": "CustomAddEdge",
            "source": "1",
            "target": "dndnode_0",
            "sourceHandle": null,
            "targetHandle": null
        },
        {
            "id": "reactflow__edge-dndnode_0-3",
            "type": "CustomAddEdge",
            "source": "dndnode_0",
            "target": "3",
            "sourceHandle": null,
            "targetHandle": null
        }
  ]
}
```

Now, let's break down the example and explain each part.

### Nodes
Nodes represent individual steps or components in a Flow. Each node has several key properties:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the node.
- **data**: Contains additional information specific to the node.
  - `name`: Name of the node.
  - `label`: Label for the node.
  - `nodeId`: Identifier for dynamic nodes.
  - `values`: Custom values for the node.
- **type**: Specifies the type of the node (e.g., `TriggerNode`, `OutputNode`, `dynamicNode`).
- **position**: The x and y coordinates of the node in the UI.
- **width** and **height**: The dimensions of the node.

Here are some examples of different types of nodes:

1. **TriggerNode**
    ```json
    {
      "id": "1",
      "data": {
        "name": "TriggerNode"
      },
      "type": "TriggerNode",
      "width": 240,
      "height": 107,
      "position": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 0
      },
      "sourcePosition": "bottom",
      "targetPosition": "top"
    }
    ```
   
2. **OutputNode**
    ```json
    {
      "id": "3",
      "data": {
        "label": "something"
      },
      "type": "OutputNode",
      "width": 240,
      "height": 107,
      "position": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 1200
      },
      "sourcePosition": "bottom",
      "targetPosition": "top"
    }
    ```

3. **DynamicNode**
    ```json
    {
      "id": "dndnode_0",
      "data": {
        "label": "dynamicNode node",
        "nodeId": "LLMNode",
        "values": {
          "nodeName": "LLM",
          "promptTemplate": "You are an expert Technical Blog Writer. Write a blog on the topic ${Flow['start']['input']}.",
          "generativeModelName": "gpt-4o"
        }
      },
      "type": "dynamicNode",
      "width": 240,
      "height": 69,
      "position": {
        "x": 676.8417187504645,
        "y": 242.5268006375551
      }
    }
    ```

### Edges
Edges define the connections between nodes, indicating the flow of data or control. Key properties include:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the edge.
- **type**: Specifies the type of the edge (e.g., `CustomAddEdge`).
- **source**: The id of the source node.
- **target**: The id of the target node.

Here are the examples of edges in the Flow:

1. **Edge from TriggerNode to dynamicNode**
    ```json
    {
      "id": "reactflow__edge-1-dndnode_0",
      "type": "CustomAddEdge",
      "source": "1",
      "target": "dndnode_0"
    }
    ```
   
2. **Edge from dynamicNode to OutputNode**
    ```json
    {
      "id": "reactflow__edge-dndnode_0-3",
      "type": "CustomAddEdge",
      "source": "dndnode_0",
      "target": "3"
    }
    ```


### Common Issues
1. **Node Overlapping**: Ensure nodes have unique positions to avoid overlapping.
2. **Missing Connections**: Verify that all nodes are correctly connected with edges.
