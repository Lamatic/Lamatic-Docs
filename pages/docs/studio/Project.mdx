# **Projects**

In the context of Studio, a project represents an individual **GenAI** application you're developing. The workspace structure allows for multiple projects to coexist, each representing a unique GenAI application with its own set of requirements and functionalities. Studio ensures that each project maintains its independence by providing dedicated resources and endpoint controls. This separation is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of your applications. Even within the same workspace, projects are designed to operate without interference, and they do not share credentials, ensuring that each project remains a self-contained unit with its own secure environment.
