## Using the Variable Selector in Lamatic.ai

The Variable Selector enables you to reuse data generated or modified by previous nodes within your workflows. This streamlined process enhances efficiency and reduces errors during workflow creation.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Select Data Source:** Choose the node from which you want to retrieve variables. For instance, if you intend to utilize variables from a GraphQL node, select `graphqlNode` from the available options.

2. **Browse Available Variables:** Upon selecting a data source, the Variable Selector will display all accessible variables from that node. These variables are categorized by type (e.g., STRING, INT, OBJECT) for easy identification of the required variable.

3. **Select the Desired Variable:** Click on the variable you wish to employ in your current node or component. The chosen variable will then be integrated into your workflow for immediate use.

### Benefits

* **Efficiency:** The Variable Selector simplifies the process of reusing data across nodes, eliminating the need for manual data entry or intricate configurations.
* **Consistency:** By employing predefined variables from preceding nodes, you ensure consistency throughout your workflow.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** The clean and intuitive interface of the Variable Selector makes it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## Handling Arrays

Let's say we have a variable of type array and we want to perform operations on it.
Variable: `graphqlNode_1234567890.output.data.books`

- To pass all the values of the array:
  ```
  {{graphqlNode_1234567890.output.data.books}}
  ```

- To pass a specific value of the array:
  ```
  {{graphqlNode_1234567890.output.data.books[0]}}
  ```

- To pass the first element of the array:
  ```
  {{graphqlNode_1234567890.output.data.books[0]}}
  ```

- To pass a range of the array:
  ```
  {{graphqlNode_1234567890.output.data.books[0:5]}}
  ```

- To extract a specific object key value pair from the array `Note: your array should be of type object with key value pairs`:
  ```
  {{graphqlNode_1234567890.output.data.books[0].name}}
  ```
