# Impact of chunking


In the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows, chunking plays a crucial role in optimizing performance and accuracy. Given that generative models have a fixed context length, chunking—dividing large data sets into manageable pieces—becomes essential. This technique enhances processing speed and accuracy by allowing models to focus on smaller data segments, reducing memory load and improving the ability to handle extensive information efficiently.
<br/> Effective chunking is pivotal in RAG workflows. The success of a RAG system can hinge on the chosen chunking strategies. Various chunking strategies exist, and selecting the appropriate one based on the specific use-case is integral to building a robust and efficient RAG workflow.
