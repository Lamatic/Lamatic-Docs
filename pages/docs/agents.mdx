# Lamatic Agents

![Agent Creation Flow Editor](./agents/img/agent-creation.webp)

Agents are AI-powered components in Lamatic that handle different types of tasks, such as generating text, processing structured data, and orchestrating multi-agent workflows. This guide introduces the different agent types and how they function within the Lamatic ecosystem.

## What are Agents?

Agents serve as specialized AI entities that execute specific tasks based on input and predefined logic. They can work independently or as part of a larger workflow inside **Flows**.
Eventually post deployment, you can interact with these agents via **API Endpoints** in a flow or execute them directly as well.

## Types of Agents

### **1. Supervisor Agent**
A **Supervisor Agent** orchestrates multiple AI agents, ensuring structured workflows by dynamically routing tasks based on input conditions.

- **Key Features:**
  - Multi-agent coordination for structured execution.
  - Memory retention for context-aware interactions.
  - Adaptive execution paths based on agent responses.
  - Check out the [Supervisor Agent](./agents/supervisor-agent.mdx) for more details.

### **2. Generate Text Agent**
A **Text Generation Agent** produces AI-generated content based on prompts. This agent is ideal for generating responses, summarizing content, or creative writing.

- **Key Features:**
  - Supports advanced language models for text generation.
  - Configurable temperature and response length.
  - Ideal for chatbots, content generation, and summarization.
  - Check out the [Text Agent](./agents/text-agent.mdx) for more details.

### **3. Generate JSON Agent**
A **JSON Agent** structures AI-generated responses into JSON format, making it useful for APIs and automated processing pipelines.

- **Key Features:**
  - Generates structured JSON outputs.
  - Useful for integrating AI with databases or APIs.
  - Ensures predictable response formats.
  - Check out the [JSON Agent](./agents/json-agent.mdx) for more details.

### **4. Multi-Modal Agent**
A **Multi-Modal Agent** processes and generates outputs across different data types, including text, images, and structured data.

- **Key Features:**
  - Supports vision-language models.
  - Processes multiple data types simultaneously.
  - Useful for applications like AI-powered design assistants.
  - Check out the [Multi-Modal Agent](./agents/multi-modal-agent.mdx) for more details.

## Best Practices

- **Choose the Right Agent:** Select the agent type that best suits your task requirements.
- **Optimize Prompts:** Well-structured prompts lead to better AI outputs.
- **Use Memory Wisely:** Enable memory retention for agents that need contextual awareness.
- **Test & Iterate:** Experiment with different configurations for the best results.

By leveraging these agent types effectively, you can build powerful AI-driven applications inside Lamatic.ai. ðŸš€
