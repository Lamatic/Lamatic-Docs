Hugging Face is a leading platform for building, hosting, and deploying state-of-the-art machine learning models. With its extensive model hub and flexible deployment options, Hugging Face allows you to use both public models and your own self-hosted endpoints. Lamatic.ai Studio enables seamless integration of these models, whether you use a managed public endpoint or a private, self-hosted endpoint for custom or fine-tuned models.
> **Lamatic.ai Studio supports both public (open-source) and private (self-hosted/dedicated) Hugging Face models.**  

> You can integrate popular models from the Hugging Face Hub or connect your own secure, fine-tuned endpoints for production use.

## Setup

### Step 1: Create a Hugging Face Account
1. Go to the [Hugging Face Hub] and sign up or log in.
2. Complete account verification if prompted.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Model Endpoint

#### Option A: Public Model Endpoint
1. Browse the [Hugging Face Hub] and find the public model you wish to use.
2. Copy the model name (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`).
3. The public inference API endpoint is:  
   `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/your-model-name`

#### Option B: Self-Hosted (Dedicated) Inference Endpoint
1. Go to [Hugging Face Inference Endpoints].

2. Create a new endpoint for your private or fine-tuned model.
3. Once deployed, copy the **Base URL** of your endpoint (e.g., `https://your-namespace.hf.space/proxy/your-endpoint`).

### Step 3: Generate Access Token
1. Visit [Hugging Face Access Tokens].
2. Create a new token with `read` or `inference` permissions.
3. Copy your access token (you will need it for Lamatic.ai Studio).

### Step 4: Configure in Lamatic.ai Studio

1. Open [Lamatic.ai Studio].
2. Navigate to the **Models** section.
3. Select **HuggingFace** from the provider list.
4. Enter the following depending on your setup:
    - **Public model:**  
      - Paste the public inference API URL or the model name.
      - Paste your Hugging Face access token.
    - **Self-hosted endpoint:**  
      - Paste your dedicated endpoint Base URL.
      - Paste your Hugging Face access token.
5. Save your configuration.

For advanced options, see [Custom Model Integration].

## Available Configuration Options

- **Model URL or Name:** The public model name, public API endpoint URL, or self-hosted endpoint Base URL
- **Access Token:** Your Hugging Face access token (required for both public and private endpoints)

## Best Practices

- **Credential Security:** Keep your access tokens private and never share them.
- **Token Rotation:** Regularly rotate your Hugging Face tokens.
- **Testing:** Test model responses after integration.
- **Production:** Use self-hosted, dedicated endpoints for critical or production workloads.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor rate limits and usage from your Hugging Face account.

## Troubleshooting

**Invalid Token:**  
- Ensure your access token is correct and has the required permissions.
- Confirm your Hugging Face account is active.

**Access Denied:**  
- Check your tokenâ€™s permissions and endpoint/model visibility.
- Make sure you have access to the deployed endpoint if using self-hosted.

**Model or Endpoint Not Found:**  
- Double-check the model name or endpoint URL.
- Confirm you have access to the model or endpoint.

**Rate Limit Exceeded:**  
- Wait before retrying requests.
- Upgrade your Hugging Face plan if necessary.

**Integration Errors:**  
- Confirm Lamatic.ai Studio configuration matches your Hugging Face setup.
- Consult [Hugging Face Docs] and [Lamatic Support] for troubleshooting.
