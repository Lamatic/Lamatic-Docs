# Testing and Debugging

[Lamatic.ai](http://Lamatic.ai) provides a comprehensive suite of tools to test and debug your flow effectively. This documentation covers essential testing methods to optimize your flow's performance in production.

## Testing Methods



### Method 1: Node-Level Testing
// TODO: Add Screenshot

Test individual nodes iteratively:

- **Execution:** Click the `▶️` button on any node to execute it along with its connected preceding nodes.
- **Output View:** Click on the node bar to access the debugging section and view the output after execution.

### Method 2: Code and Prompt Testing
// TODO: Add Screenshot

Test specific components independently:

- **Code & Prompts:** Test code in a code node or prompts in any AI generator node.
- **Testing Button:** Click "Test" in the IDE to run the component. The system will prompt you to run prior nodes if needed to generate the output.

### Method 3: Complete Flow Testing
// TODO: Add Screenshot

Run a full flow test for end-to-end execution:

- **Execution:** Click the "Test" button to execute all nodes in sequence.
- **Progress Tracking:** Observe node-level progress during execution.
- **Output Review:** View the final output generated at the end of the flow.

### Method 4: Save Test Case

Ensure repeatable and consistent testing:

- **Define Test Cases:** Create test cases for automated testing, reducing manual input for each test run.

## Debugging and Preview Features

### Debugging Tool
// TODO: Add Screenshot

After testing, use the debugging tool to:

- **Detailed Output:** Review a node-by-node breakdown of the latest test execution.
- **Issue Identification:** Diagnose and troubleshoot issues within your flow.

### Preview Function
// TODO: Add Screenshot

For widget-triggered flows:

- **UI Preview:** Use the preview feature to visualize widget appearance and functionality.
- **Configuration Check:** Ensure interface elements are correctly set before deployment.

## Trigger-Specific Testing Approaches

Different triggers require unique testing methods:

| **Trigger Type** | **Input Method**               | **Testing Procedure**                                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API**          | Sample API request payload     | 1. Enter or choose the payload 2. Run the test              |
| **Widget**       | Sample payload or interaction  | 1. Interact with the widget or enter/choose payload 2. Run the test |
| **Webhook**      | Sample or actual webhook data  | 1. Send data to the specified webhook or enter/choose payload 2. Run the test |
| **App**          | Sample payload or event sim    | 1. Perform the desired trigger event or enter/choose payload 2. Run the test |

## Deployment Testing
// TODO: Add Screenshot

Ensure smooth production transitions:

- **Predefined Test Cases:** Set up automatic test cases to run before deployment.
- **Deployment Condition:** The system deploys the project only if all tests pass.
- **Failure Protocol:** In case of test failures, the system reverts to the last stable version.

By following these methods and utilizing [Lamatic.ai](http://Lamatic.ai)'s testing tools, you can ensure your flow is robust, efficient, and ready for production deployment.
