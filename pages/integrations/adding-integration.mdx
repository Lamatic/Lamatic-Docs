# Adding a New Integration

To incorporate a new data source or app integration into your flow, follow these general steps:

1. **Select the Integration**: Choose the appropriate integration node from the Lamatic Studio Integration
2. **Configure Credentials**: Set up authentication and access permissions for the external service
3. **Define Parameters**: Configure specific settings like file paths, sync schedules, or data filters
4. **Test Connection**: Verify the integration works correctly with your data source
5. **Deploy Flow**: Activate the integration within your Lamatic workflow

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Each integration has specific setup requirements. Refer to the individual integration documentation for detailed configuration instructions.

## **Using Integrations in Flows**

Lamatic's flexible architecture allows you to:

- **Combine Multiple Sources**: Use different integrations within a single flow
- **Chain Operations**: Process data from one source and feed it to another
- **Schedule Synchronization**: Set up automated data refresh schedules
- **Handle Different Formats**: Process various file types and data structures

### **Common Use Cases**

- **RAG Applications**: Use file storage integrations to feed documents into vector databases
- **Data Processing**: Combine spreadsheet and database integrations for comprehensive data analysis
- **Content Automation**: Use web crawling and search integrations for content generation
- **Team Workflows**: Integrate communication platforms for automated team notifications

## **Integration Best Practices**

### **Security**
- Use environment-specific credentials for development and production
- Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens
- Implement proper access controls and permissions
- Store sensitive credentials securely using Lamatic's encryption

### **Performance**
- Configure appropriate sync schedules to balance data freshness and system load
- Use incremental sync modes when possible to reduce processing time
- Monitor integration performance and adjust settings as needed

### **Data Quality**
- Validate data formats and structures before processing
- Implement error handling for failed integrations
- Set up monitoring and alerting for integration issues
- Document data schemas and transformation requirements

> âš¡ **Quick Tip**: Start with a simple integration and gradually add complexity as you become familiar with the platform's capabilities.
