## Setup

### Step 1: Set Up AWS Credentials

1.  **Create IAM Policy**:

    - Navigate to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#home).
    - Create a new policy with required S3 permissions.
    - Use the provided JSON policy template.

      ```json
          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Action": [
                          "s3:GetObject",
                          "s3:ListBucket",
                          "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
                      ],
                      "Resource": "*"
                  }
              ]
          }
      ```



      <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
        Note: If you want to given permission only to specific buckets then add
        them to resource key, refer the below example
      </Callout>

      ```json
      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:GetObject",
                  "s3:ListBucket"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                      "arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name-1}/*",
                      "arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name-1}",
                      "arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name-2}/*",
                      "arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name-2}"
                  ]
              }
          ]
      }
      ```


      <Callout>
        Note: At this time, object-level permissions alone are not sufficient to
        successfully authenticate the connection. Please ensure you include the
        bucket-level permissions as provided in the example above.
      </Callout>

      <br />
      If you want to restrict the usage to specific bucket then you can create the
      policy as follows:


        ```json
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "s3:GetObject",
                        "s3:ListBucket"
                    ],
                    "Resource": [
                        "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
                        "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                    "Resource": "*"
                }
            ]

        }
        ```
        <Callout>
        Note: You need to make sure that you are giving `ListAllMyBuckets` permission with resource as `*` else you will not be able to see the available buckets in the node config.
      </Callout>

2.  **Configure IAM User**:

    - Create or select an IAM user.
    - Attach the created policy.
    - Generate and securely store access credentials.

      <Callout type="error" emoji="️⚠️">
        Caution: Your Secret Access Key will only be visible once upon creation.
        Be sure to copy and store it securely.
      </Callout>
      <br/>
      For more information on managing your access keys, please refer to the official [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

### Step 2: Configure S3 Credentials

Use the following format to set up your credentials:

| **Key Name**          | **Description**                                     | **Example Value**           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Credential Name**   | Name to identify this set of credentials            | `my-s3-creds`               |
| **AWS Access Key**    | AWS access key ID for authentication                | `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`      |
| **AWS Secret Key**    | AWS secret access key for authentication            | `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY` |

### Step 3: Set Up Lamatic Flow

1. Add the S3 node to your flow.
2. Provide necessary credentials and bucket details.
3. Configure sync settings, schedule, and file filters.

    |------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
    | **Credentials**              | Specifies the credentials required to access the S3 bucket. Ensure you have appropriate IAM credentials configured for the node.                      | Pre-configured S3 credentials (e.g., "S3").           | Mandatory                              |
    | **Bucket**                   | Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that the node will interact with.                                                                             | Example: `new-testing-12345`.                          | Mandatory                              |
    | **Parsing Strategy**         | Defines how files in the S3 bucket will be parsed.                                                                                                      | `Auto` (automatic detection), other custom strategies. | Default: `Auto`                        |
    | **Globs (Path Patterns)**    | Allows specifying file path patterns to include or exclude files during processing.                                                                      | Example: `*.csv` (include all CSV files).              | Default: None (all files included).    |
    | **Days to Sync If History Is Full** | Defines how many days' worth of historical data to sync when the history is full.                                                                 | Example: `3`.                                           | Default: `3`.                          |
    | **Start Date**               | Specifies the date from which the node should begin syncing files.                                                                                       | Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`.                                  | Default: Empty (process all files).    |
    | **Sync Mode**                | Determines how the synchronization is performed.                                                                                                        | `Incremental` (new/updated files), other modes.        | Default: `Incremental`.                |
    | **Sync Schedule**            | Defines the frequency at which the synchronization process occurs.                                                                                      | `Every 24 hours`, custom intervals (e.g., hourly).     | Default: `Every 24 hours`.             |


    ##### Credentials
    These are the authentication details used to connect to the S3 bucket. You must configure IAM credentials with appropriate permissions (e.g., read access to the bucket).

    ##### Bucket
    The S3 bucket acts as the data source for this trigger. Enter the name of the bucket where your files are stored.

    ##### Parsing Strategy
    This option determines how the files will be interpreted.

    - `auto` lets the system decide the best way to parse files, while other strategies might require manual setup for specific file types.
    - `fast` extracts text directly from the document which doesn't work for all files.
    - `ocr_only` is more reliable, but slower.


    ##### Globs (Path Patterns)
    Use glob patterns to filter which files should be processed.

    - `**`: match everything.
    - `**/*.csv`: match all files with a specific extension.
    - `myFolder/**/*.csv`: match all `.csv` files anywhere under `myFolder`.
    - `*/**`: match everything at least one folder deep.
    - `*/*/*/**`: match everything at least three folders deep.
    - `**/file.*|**/file`: match every file called "file" with any extension (or no extension).
    - `x/*/y/*`: match all files that sit in folder `x -> any folder -> folder y`.
    - `**/prefix*.csv`: match all `.csv` files with a specific prefix.
    - `**/prefix*.parquet`: match all `.parquet` files with a specific prefix.

    This is helpful for excluding unnecessary files.

    ##### Supported File Types

    Only specific file types are currently supported for vectorization and indexing in Lamatic. Using unsupported formats may result in parsing errors during synchronization.

    ##### ✅ Allowed File Extensions

    - `.pdf` — PDF Documents  
    - `.txt` — Plain Text Files  
    - `.docx` — Microsoft Word  
    - `.pptx` — Microsoft PowerPoint  
    - `.md` — Markdown Files

    To avoid sync issues, ensure your **glob patterns** are configured to include only these types.

    ##### 🔍 Recommended Glob Pattern

    ```yaml
        globs:
        - "**/*.pdf"
        - "**/*.txt"
        - "**/*.docx"
        - "**/*.pptx"
        - "**/*.md"
    ```

    ##### Days to Sync If History Is Full
    If the system encounters a large backlog of files, this setting limits the synchronization to a defined number of recent days. It helps manage processing time and storage efficiently.

    ##### Start Date
    Define a specific date from which the system should start processing files. This is particularly useful for incremental syncs where you only want to process data from a certain point in time.
    <br/>
    Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ`
    <br/>
    Example: `2025-01-03T00:00:00.000000Z`

    ##### Sync Mode
    The S3 source connector supports the following:

    1. In `Incremental` mode, the system only processes files that have been added or updated since the last sync. This reduces redundancy and improves performance.

    1. `Full Refresh` sync mode is a data replication method that copies all data from a source to a destination

    ##### Sync Schedule
    This setting allows you to specify how often the synchronization process should run, such as every hour or every 24 hours. Regular intervals ensure that your data stays updated.
    You can Schedule the Sync on Every 3, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours
