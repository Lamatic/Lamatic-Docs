# Flow Debugging
Lamatic Studio provides powerful tools to help developers debug and test their flows efficiently. Use the debug mode to simulate inputs, capture outputs, and iterate quickly.
<br/>
With Flow Debugging you can:
- **Save test cases** to reuse and iterate faster.
- **Inspect input, output, logs, and token usage** for each node in your flow.
- **View estimated token cost** per test run to manage expenses better.
- **Identify and fix issues precisely** ‚Äî no more guessing what went wrong.

## Running Debug Mode
![Debugging](./img/debug.gif)

1. Go to your **Flow Editor**.
2. Click the **Debug** Button in the bottom right.
3. Enter your test input data (as JSON or plain text).
4. Hit **Run Test** to simulate execution.

<Callout emoji="üí°">
Each test run executes the full flow using your provided input, showing node-by-node progress and output.
</Callout>

Each test execution visualizes:

- Node-by-node status (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- Real-time inputs & outputs
- Token usage breakdown

## Saving Test Cases

Click the plus (+) icon to add and save new test cases.

### To Save a Test Case:

1. Enter your input data.
2. Click the plus (+) icon
3. Give it a name (e.g., `User sign-up flow test`).

### To Reuse a Test Case:

- Select the saved test case from the **Saved Tests** dropdown and click **Run Test**.

## Debugging Output

After running a test:

- Each node will show a status: ‚úÖ Success, ‚ùå Error.
- Click on any node to inspect:
  - **Input received**
  - **Output generated**
  - **Execution time**
  - **Error messages** (if any)
