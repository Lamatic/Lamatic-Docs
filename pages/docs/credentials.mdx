## Accessing Apps and Data Sources

With the credentials properly configured, your Lamatic.ai application can interact with external services via their APIs. There's no need to deal with the intricacies of API keys, authentication mechanisms, or managing HTTP requests. Lamatic.ai takes care of these complexities for you. 

Simply select the app or data source you want to connect to, input the required credentials, and let Lamatic.ai handle the rest. Configure any specific parameters if needed, and your integration will be ready to use. 

This streamlined approach allows you to focus on building and deploying your solutions without the hassle of managing multiple authentication flows.
