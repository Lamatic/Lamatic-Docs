<Steps>
The Quickest Way to Get Started with lamatic is using pre built templates

### Create a new Flow
Start by creating a new flow in Lamatic Studio. This will be the foundation of your project where you can define the sequence of operations.

### Select a Template
Choose a pre-built template that matches your project requirements. Templates provide a quick way to set up common flow without starting from scratch.

### Fill in the required fields for Flow Nodes
Populate the necessary fields for each node in your flow. These fields define the specific actions and data that each node will process.

### Test the Flow
Run tests to ensure that your flow works as expected. Testing helps identify and fix any issues before deployment.

### Deploy the Project
Once your flow is tested and verified, deploy the project to make it live. Deployment moves your project from the development environment to production.
