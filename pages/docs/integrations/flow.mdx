# Flow Node Documentation

The Flow Node allows you to call and execute other flows from within your current flow, enabling modular and reusable flow designs.

## Overview

The Flow Node provides the ability to:

- Execute other flows as sub-flows
- Use current flow's data as input for the flow to be called
- Reuse existing flows as building blocks for more complex workflows

## Flow Node Configuration

| Key Name      | Required | Description                                                                                                        | Sample Value                               |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Flow ID       | ✅       | Select an active flow with API Request, Chat, or Search trigger from the dropdown                                  | `4be6dea6-d13c-44d8-87cf-5ad46361c890`     |
| Request Input | ✅       | Input parameters key will be auto-populated based on the selected flow, just make sure you fill value for each key | `{  "prompt": "{{triggerNode_1.output}}"}` |

## Usage Guidelines

### Calling Other Flows

1. Add a Flow Node to your current workflow
2. Select the target flow you want to execute from the dropdown
3. Configure any input parameters needed by the target flow
4. The output of the called flow will be received

### Best Practices

- **Modular Design**: Break down complex flows into smaller, reusable flows
- **Data Passing**: Carefully plan what data needs to be passed between flows

## Troubleshooting Guidelines

- **Flow Not Found**: Ensure the Flow ID is correct and the target flow exists and is active and you have deployed the project for latest changes.
- **Parameter Mismatch**: Verify that input parameters match the expected format of the target flow, we autofill the key for you but make sure you fill in value for each key accordingly.
- **Permissions**: Check that you have the necessary permissions to execute the flow

## Example Use Cases

**Multi-step Processing**: Break down complex processes into manageable sub-flows
