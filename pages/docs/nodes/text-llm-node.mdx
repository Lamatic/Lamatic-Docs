# Text LLM Node Documentation

The Text LLM node allows users to programmatically generate text outputs by submitting prompts to selected LLMs. These text outputs can be further processed within each flow. This node is particularly useful for applications requiring dynamic text creation, such as chatbots, content creation, and automated report generation.
