This guide will help you build an AI-powered system that generates image descriptions using a multimodal node. The system processes image URLs, analyzes the content, and produces detailed textual descriptions. This tool can be used for various applications, including accessibility, content tagging, and automated captioning.

## What You'll Build

A smart image processing API that takes an image URL as input, uses a multimodal node to analyze the image, and generates a structured description. The generated output provides detailed insights about the image, enabling seamless and accurate image-to-text conversion for a wide range of applications.

## Getting Started

### 1. Project Setup

1. Sign up at [Lamatic.ai](https://lamatic.ai/) and log in.
1. Navigate to the Projects and click **New Project** or select your desired project.
1. You'll see different sections like Flows, Context, and Connections

### 2. Creating a New Flow

1. Navigate to Flows, select New Flow.
1. Click **Create from scratch** as starting point.
1. Next, click Choose a Trigger, where you can select an API Request, App, or Widget Interface as your trigger. Weâ€™ll use the API Request under the interface option.

### 4. Adding Multi Modal Node

1. Click the + icon to add a new node.
2. Choose "Multi Modal LLM".

3. Configure the AI model:
   - Select your "Open AI" credentials
   - Choose "gpt-4" as your Model
4. Set up your prompt:

```
You are a photo editor. Your task is to craft a concise, vivid, and engaging caption that accurately describes the attached photo, making it easy for someone to visualize the scene without seeing it.
Focus on key details, emotions, and context to create a compelling description: {{triggerNode_1.output.photo}}
```

5. In the attachments add Image URL as variable.

### 5. Configuring the reponse

1. Click the API response node
   ![Flow API Schema](./img/image-description-generator/flow-api-schema.png)
2. Add Output Variables by clicking the + icon
3. Select variable from your **Multi Modal LLM** Node

### 6. Test the flow

1. Click on 'API Request' trigger node
2. Click on Configure test
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/ai-image-reviewer/testing.png)
3. Fill sample value in 'url' and click on test

### 7. Deployment

1. Click the Deploy button
   ![Flow Deploy](./img/ai-review-responder/deploy.png)
2. Your API is now ready to be integrated into Node.js or Python applications
3. Your flow will run on Lamatic's global edge network for fast, scalable performance

### 8. What's Next?

- Experiment with different prompts
- Try other AI models
- Add more processing steps to your flow
- Integrate the API into your applications

### 10. Tips

- Save your tests for reuse across different scenarios
- Use consistent JSON structures for better maintainability
- Test thoroughly before deployment

Now you have a working AI-powered API! You can expand on this foundation to build more complex applications using Lamatic.ai's features.
