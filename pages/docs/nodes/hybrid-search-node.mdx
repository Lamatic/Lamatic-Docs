## Output

#### `searchResults`
- An array of objects, each representing a search result with its associated data and scoring information.

  - **`_additional`**: Contains extra metadata about the search result.
  - **`score`**: A string indicating the relevance or confidence score of the result, as provided in the additional metadata.
  - **`data`**: A string containing the content or information retrieved for the search result.
  - **`score`** (duplicate at the top level): Same as the one inside `_additional`.


### Example Output

```json
{
    "searchResults": [
      {
        "_additional": {
          "score": "0.25"
        },

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| **Problem**                    | **Solution**                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Invalid API Key**            | Ensure the API key is correct and has not expired.           |
| **Dynamic Content Not Loaded** | Increase the `Wait for Page Load` time in the configuration. |

### Debugging

1. Check Lamatic Flow logs for error details.
1. Verify API Key.
