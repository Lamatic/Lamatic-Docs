#  Response

At the end of your intelligent workflow is the output - the final insights, predictions, texts, images or other content generated by your AI models and transformations. The Response node allows you to capture and flexibly route these workflow outputs to their desired destinations.

## Connecting to Downstream Systems

The Response node provides pre-built connectors to integrate your AI-generated data with a variety of downstream platforms and applications:

**Messaging & Notifications** 

Publish messages, alerts or notifications containing workflow outputs to services like Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, push notifications.

**Data Stores**

Insert or update records in databases and data warehouses with the generative results. Supports SQL, NoSQL, events stores.

**Search & Vector Stores**

Index text outputs by converting to vector embeddings and storing in semantic search engines like Weaviate for retrieval.  

**Logging & Monitoring**

Capture structured logs of outputs for observability. Integrate with monitoring services to track workflow metrics.

## Advanced Response Handling

In addition to the basic routing capabilities, the Response node provides powerful capabilities for streamlining your AI output handling:

**Multi-Destination Fanning**

A single output can be fanned out and delivered to multiple destination systems simultaneously with one node.

**Content Filtering**

Use rules to apply filtering and transformations on outputs before delivery based on content, metatada or policies.
